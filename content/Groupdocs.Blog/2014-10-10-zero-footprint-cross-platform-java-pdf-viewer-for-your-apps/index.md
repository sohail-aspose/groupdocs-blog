[![Java PDF Viewer Library - GroupDocs](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/GD_VWR_JavaIcon_1141.png)](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library)[GroupDocs.Viewer for Java](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library) is a lightweight library that allows developers to display PDF (as well as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and over 50 other types of documents) within their Java apps. The Java PDF viewer provides cross-platform compatibility, allowing end users to view PDF documents from any web-enabled device, including mobiles and tablets. The viewer works with all modern browsers: IE8+, Chrome, FireFox, Safari 5+, Opera and their mobile versions. There is no need to install anything on the client side. Users can view PDFs without having to install Adobe Acrobat Reader.

#### Fast & Clear PDF RenderingDepending on the chosen rendering mode, the viewer rasterizes PDFs to images or converts them to pure HTML+CSS+SVG. When rasterizing documents, the library extracts text and renders it on a separate layer on top of background images. As a result, both modes provide high-fidelity font rendering - texts look sharp regardless of the zoom factor. The Java PDF viewer library can load remote documents via URLs, from streams and files located on your storage. To load documents faster, the library cashes PDFs on the server side when they are loaded (viewed by a user) for the first time. There is also an AOT (ahead-of-time) caching option that allows you to force the library to add any specified PDF to cache before it has even been displayed to users.

#### Convenient User InterfaceWe’ve packaged our Java PDF viewer with an out-of-the-box web UI that helps end users to easily navigate PDFs in a web-browser. You can adjust the UI's look and feel by tweaking CSS or completely customize its functionality by complementing the JavaScript front-end. The demo below gives an idea of how the UI can be customized to match your app or website requirements. The embedded PDF document you see in the demo represents the default look and functionality of the UI, while the demo viewer itself is slightly tweaked with our CSS: In addition to that, the library provides a choice between English, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian and Russian UI localizations.

#### Keep Your PDFs SafeThe GroupDocs.Viewer for Java library comes as downloadable JAR that can be deployed on your own server and behind your firewalls. All your PDFs are processed locally and hosted on your server, which ensures complete control over documents’ security. If you don’t want users to copy the contents of displayed PDFs, the printing, downloading and text copying options can be restricted or removed from the UI at all. And for an additional layer of security, the library allows you to add watermarks over the displayed PDF documents.
