[![GroupDocs.Signature for .NET Library](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/10/GD_SGN_NETIcon_1141.png)](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/electronic-signature-library)We are glad to announce the release of the [GroupDocs Signature for .NET Library](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/electronic-signature-library). The library is developed based on our [online signature app](http://groupdocs.com/apps/signature) and enables developers to easily add electronic signature capabilities to their own ASP.NET, C#/VB.NET applications. It's a one-stop-shop solution, which includes all the necessary controls for a complete, legally-binding electronic signature workflow. Key features include: **Electronic Signature Capture Control** Users can sign documents either by uploading a scanned copy of their signature, or by drawing it right in a web-browser with a mouse. **Signature Audit Trails and Anti-tampering** GroupDocs Signature allows you to record and store detailed logs on document processing. It also applies unique hash records to documents at each signing stage in order to prevent alterations. This makes GroupDocs Signature compliant with the E-SIGN act and allows you to provide your app's users with a legally binding alternative to a conventional paper-based signing workflow. **Cross-Format Support** Users can upload documents of just about any common business format, including Microsoft Office documents (DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, etc.), Visio diagrams (VSD, VDX), PDF and CAD files, images (TIFF, JPG, JPEG). The files are converted to PDF and can be signed online, from a web-browser. **Convenient Signing Workflows** An intuitive workspace allows end users to manage documents, save contacts and store signatures for reuse. Automatic reminders are sent to signers who have not signed a document and notifications inform all parties when signatures are applied. **Complete Control Over Documents** GroupDocs Signature for .NET can be installed and hosted using your own infrastructure. As a result, documents can be stored, processed and accessed from your own servers and behind your firewalls. **Easy Integration** The library is lightweight and can be integrated with a single DLL. There's no need for client-side installation, as the app runs on all modern browsers. We also provide free technical support during the whole integration period to help you get up and running quickly. If you'd like to integrate the GroupDocs Signatures for .NET Library into your own project, you can [download a free trial version](http://groupdocs.com/Community/getting-started/dot-net/electronic-signature-library.aspx), or [contact our sales team](http://groupdocs.com/corporate/contact-us) for a free 30-day evaluation license which comes with a fully-functional version of the library.
