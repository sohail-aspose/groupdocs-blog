## What is GroupDocs Annotation?GroupDocs Annotation is a cloud-based application that lets you share and review documents online. The workflow is simple. First of all, select a document from your GroupDocs library or upload a document, and then share it with your team members. Invited members give suggestion and exchange ideas to improve the document. There is no need to write emails back and forth during the review: everyone involved is notified once comments or notes are added. This mechanism helps avoid confusion and people can manage tasks easily. With GroupDocs it's not a cumbersome task to [annotate PDF](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation) or Word documents. GroupDocs Annotation supports most popular file formats! GroupDocs Annotation is effective when collaborating in global teams. Constant reviews and updates are needed. GroupDocs Annotation allows you to streamline the review process and reduce the communication gap. From online PDF annotation to online image annotation, GroupDocs' app lets you share ideas, communicate and complete tasks faster.
