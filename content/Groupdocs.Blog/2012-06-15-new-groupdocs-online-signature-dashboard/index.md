The GroupDocs team is proud to introduce a brand new dashboard for its online signature app. The user interface is significantly improved: both design and functionality were modified in order to make the GroupDocs Signature Dashboard more intuitive, user-friendly and convenient for a fast and hassle-free online document signing process. Let's have a closer look at the new features of the GroupDocs Signature Dashboard.

## Simple WorkflowThe [online signature](http://groupdocs.com/apps/signature) application guides you through each and every step of the online signing process. This simple workflow won't let you make a mistake during the process but enables you to get documents signed in minutes. The document preparation process now includes six simple steps. A wizard-style interface guides you, step by step, so that you don't get stuck. \[caption id="attachment\_498" align="alignnone" width="627" caption="GroupDocs' online signature app has a wizard-style interface"\]![GroupDocs' online signature app has a wizard-style interface](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/06/six-steps-of-workflow.png "GroupDocs' online signature app has a wizard-style interface")\[/caption\]
