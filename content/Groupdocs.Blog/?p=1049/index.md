GroupDocs has introduced its [Annotation Plugin for WordPress](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/plugins/annotation/wordpress). **GroupDocs Annotation** is a web-based apps that lets you [annotate PDF](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation) and Microsoft Office documents online, right from a web-browser. The plugin itself allows you to embed documents to WordPress web-pages and then annotate the documents using the GroupDocs' Annotation app. You can annotate the embedded documents in a very similar way to how you do it in Microsoft Word. For example, you can highlight and strike out text, add notes, draw lines, comment on a particular area in a document, etc. Besides Microsoft Office documents and PDF annotation, GroupDocs also allows you to add notes to images, which is very useful when reviewing pictures, layouts, graphics etc. Another handy feature - collaborative review - allows you to send an annotated document for approval or even share it with your partners/colleagues in real-time for collaborative annotation. \[caption id="attachment\_1052" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="GroupDocs' PDF annotation plugin for WordPress"\]![GroupDocs' PDF annotation plugin for WordPress](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/11/Announcing-GroupDocs-Annotation-app-plugin-for-WordPress1.jpg "GroupDocs' PDF annotation plugin for WordPress")\[/caption\]
