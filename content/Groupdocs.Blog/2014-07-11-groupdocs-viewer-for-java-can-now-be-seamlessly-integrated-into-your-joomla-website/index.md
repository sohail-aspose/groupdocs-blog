![GroupDocs.Viewer for Java icon](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/GD_VWR_JavaIcon_1141.png)We're glad to announce the release of the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java extension for Joomla!. Developers who work with the [Java version of our HTML5 document viewer](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library) can now seamlessly integrate it into Joomla! websites. The extension has been approved by the Joomla! marketplace team and is available for download from the official Joomla! marketplace. With the GroupDocs.Viewer integrated into Joomla!, you can easily embed and display all documents supported by the viewer on your Joomla! web-pages. These include: PDF and Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Visio diagrams, CAD files, raster images and a lot more - over 50 file formats in total. Documents can be embedded to a web-page along with the GroupDocs.Viewer's UI, which allows users to conveniently navigate large documents right on a web-page. The extension is free for developers who have a GroupDocs.Viewer for Java license. If you don't have a license yet, but would like to test the Java version of the GroupDocs.Viewer on your Joomla! website, please download a free evaluation copy of the library from [this page](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library).
