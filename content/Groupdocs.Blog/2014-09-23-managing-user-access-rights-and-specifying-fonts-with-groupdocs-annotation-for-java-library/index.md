[![](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/04/GD_ANT_JavaIcon_1141.png "GroupDocs.Annotation for Java")](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-annotation-library)GroupDocs.Annotation for Java is a lightweight [document annotation Java library](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-annotation-library) that allows the placing of markup and comments in Microsoft Office documents, PDFs, images and over 50 other file types. It provides end users with a rich set of markup tools and can be used on any web-enabled device without the need to install third-party software. Thanks to its cross-platform compatibility and convenient UI, GroupDocs.Annotation is an ideal solution if you need to add document annotation functionality to your Java application. Recently Iâ€™ve added two short guides covering minor, but quite common, requests from GroupDocs.Annotation customers and would like to share them with you: **Manage User Rights in GroupDocs.Annotation for Java** GroupDocs.Annotation has a user authentication/authorization system that allows you to grant and restrict different access rights to certain users. Using it, the library can be easily integrated into the user management system used in your own application. You can find the guide on [this page](http://groupdocs.com/docs/display/annotationjava/Managing+User+Access+Rights+in+the+GroupDocs.Annotation+for+Java+Library). **Setting the TrueType Fonts for Document Exporting** GroupDocs.Annotation for Java uses the TruType fonts to render annotations and to export documents with annotations. These fonts may be absent in Linux OSs. [This guide](http://groupdocs.com/docs/display/annotationjava/Installing+the+TrueType+Fonts+Required+to+Export+Documents) shows how to install the fonts to be able to export documents properly.
