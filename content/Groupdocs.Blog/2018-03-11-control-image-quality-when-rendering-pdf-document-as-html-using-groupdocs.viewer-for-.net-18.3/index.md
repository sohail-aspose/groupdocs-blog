[![GroupDocs Viewer for .NET](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/11/groupdocs-viewer-net.png)](https://www.groupdocs.com/products/viewer/net)

We are pleased to announce the release of version 18.3 of [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/net). Using the latest version, you can now render **XLTM** and **XLTX** file formats. We have also added settings to control the image quality when rendering PDF documents as HTML. Furthermore, this version came up with 11 improvements and bug fixes. Letâ€™s have a quick overview of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET 18.3.

## Supported File FormatsWe have added the support of following file formats in version 18.3 of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET.

*   XLTM (Excel Open XML Macro-Enabled Spreadsheet)
*   XLTX (Excel Open XML Spreadsheet Template)

## Specifying Image Quality when Rendering PDF Documents as HTMLWhen rendering PDF documents as HTML, GroupDocs.Viewer creates a single image resource which contains all the images from the PDF document page. The API uses this image as the background for output HTML document. Since version 18.3, we have added the settings that are used to control the quality of the image resource. Following code sample shows how to get the best quality images when rendering PDF document as HTML.```
//Init viewer configuration
ViewerConfig viewerConfig = new ViewerConfig();
viewerConfig.StoragePath = "c:\\storage";
   
// Init ViewerHtmlHandler 
ViewerHtmlHandler viewerHtmlHandler = new ViewerHtmlHandler(viewerConfig);
   
// Set the guid of the document you want to render
string guid = "with-images.pdf";
   
//Set desired image quality in the output HTML document
HtmlOptions htmlOptions = new HtmlOptions();
htmlOptions.PdfOptions.ImageQuality = ImageQuality.High;
  
//Render document with specified options
List pages = viewerHtmlHandler.GetPages(guid, htmlOptions);

foreach (PageHtml page in pages)
{
    //..
}
