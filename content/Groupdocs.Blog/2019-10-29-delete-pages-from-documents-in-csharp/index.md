We'll see how to remove a single page or a collection of specific page numbers from the source document in C# using [GroupDocs.Merger for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net). This is a back-end API that can be integrated into any new or existing .NET application without any dependency.

## **Does it require any software installation?**

Absolutely not. It doesn't matter if MS Office or any PDF reader is installed on your computer. Using a single GroupDocs.Merger for .NET [DLL](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/merger/net) you can develop a web, console, or desktop application to delete the pages.

## **Remove Selected Page from PDF using C#**

Below are the steps to remove the document page(s) from a PDF document with C# code. Just by changing the document name and extension, we can perform the same operation for the [supported document formats](https://docs.groupdocs.com/merger/net/supported-document-formats/).

*   Initialize RemoveOptions class with page numbers to remove.
*   Instantiate Merger object with source document path or stream.
*   Call RemovePages method and pass RemoveOptions object to it.
*   Call Save method and pass desired file path to save the resultant document.
