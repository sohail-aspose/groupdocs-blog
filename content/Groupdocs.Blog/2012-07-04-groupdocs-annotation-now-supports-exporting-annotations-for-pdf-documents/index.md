**GroupDocs** document management suite allows you to [view](http://groupdocs.com/apps/viewer), [annotate](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation), [compare](http://groupdocs.com/apps/comparison), [assemble](http://groupdocs.com/apps/assembly), [digitally sign](http://groupdocs.com/apps/signature) and share your documents in the cloud. As [previously been announced](https://blog.groupdocs.com/announcing-new-features-of-the-groupdocs-annotation-app), **GroupDocs Annotation** is one of our flagship applications that take the peer/group-review to a whole new level by providing you and your colleagues an easy way to view and share review comments in real-time. Proof-reading has never been so easy and fun! Be it real-time or traditional way of reviewing the documents, GroupDocs Annotation is all that you require to collaboratively perform a document review at anytime, from anywhere. A [set of cool features](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation/features) makes GroupDocs Annotation one of the best and most affordable [PDF annotation](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation "pdf annotation") tools currently available in the market. Its easy work-flows as well as intuitive user interface make it a breeze to learn and fun to use. Our Dev Gurus are continuously refining the **GroupDocs Application Suite** to bring you [more exciting features](https://blog.groupdocs.com/) every now and then. More recently, we have added a new feature to GroupDocs Annotation that lets you export the annotated PDF with the comments and annotations in place. These notes, annotations and comments then become part of this new exported file and can be viewed in any popular PDF reader. More excitingly, it supports various types of annotations, such as Text annotation, Area annotation, Polyline annotation etc to suite your requirements. Each annotation is exported with the email address of the reviewer so you know that whose opinion is what. Also it greatly helps in keeping an offline record of all different “reviewed” versions of a particular document.

The work-flow of this powerful feature is so easy to use that it takes only one click to export the annotated PDF file to your local drive. An automatically generated file downloads to your local machine each time you click the Export button. So you may keep as many versions of an annotated file as you require and make sure that you don't miss any important review comment.
