[![GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET Library logo](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/02/GD_ANT_NETIcon_114.png)](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-annotation-library)Good news for Orchard developers and site owners – after a successful release of the module that integrates GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET into Orchard CMS, we’re pleased to inform you that we’ve recently released yet another module - this time for integrating the .NET version of the [GroupDocs.Annotation library](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-annotation-library). Like GroupDocs.Viewer, the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library supports all common business document formats, provides cross-platform compatibility and doesn’t require any installations on the client side. In addition to that, the library provides comprehensive document annotation functionality that allows your users collaboratively review and annotate documents on your Orchard site. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET features 14+ annotation tools (including sticky notes, polyline, rectangle, arrow, text underline and strikethrough, redaction, watermarks, ruler, etc.), supports native PDF and Microsoft Word annotations and allows several uses to annotate the same document simultaneously. With this new module, Orchard developers now have a choice between two deployment options:

*   On-premises - by installing the downloadable GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library.
*   SaaS – by integrating the cloud version of the annotator.

Users who already have a GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET license can use this new Orchard module for free. If you don’t have a license yet, but would like to test the annotator on your Orchard site, please feel free to [contact GroupDocs](http://groupdocs.com/corporate/contact-us) sales for a 30-day trial license, or simply [download](http://groupdocs.com/Community/getting-started/dot-net/document-annotation-library.aspx) an evaluation copy of the library. For more details on the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET module, please visit the Orchard gallery.
