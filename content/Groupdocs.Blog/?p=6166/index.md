**GroupDocs.Conversion for Java: convert common document types to HTML**

We’re pleased to announce support for a new file format in GroupDocs.Conversion for Java version 1.2.0, released this month. Developers can now convert all file types supported by the library to HTML. These include PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Project, Outlook and many more. In the output you can either get a complete web page (HTML + CSS + images), or send converted resources (text, fonts, images, etc.) to streams.

In addition to this, we’ve also added support for Microsoft Word bookmarks and implemented the ability to convert and merge several files into a single PDF document. For more details on these new features, please see this article and download the latest version of GroupDocs.Conversion for Java from [this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/9/java-libraries/groupdocs_conversion_for_java/entry7605.aspx).

**GroupDocs.Viewer for Java: improved document rendering and front-end reliability**

In GroupDocs.Viewer for Java 2.12.0 we’ve improved the overall document rendering accuracy as well as implementing over 25 minor improvements and bug fixes. In this release we’ve also added a new parameter – **imageWebRequestTimeout** – which allows you to control the timeout of web requests when displaying images loaded from URLs in the HTML-based rendering mode. For more details on this release and to download GroupDocs.Viewer for Java version 2.12.0, please go to [this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/9/java-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_java/entry7738.aspx).

**GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: caching PDF copies of original documents**

[Last month](https://blog.groupdocs.com/) we introduced two updates in GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET – the ability to cache PDF copies of original files and use an unlimited number of different independent root storage paths. These features proved to be valuable to our users and we decided to write a dedicated article providing more details on how you can benefit from them. In case you missed the article, you can find it [here](https://blog.groupdocs.com/groupdocs-viewer-for-net-caching-pdf-copies-of-original-documents-and-using-multiple-root-storage-paths).
