[![Logo Image](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/12/groupdocs-annotation-java.png)](https://products.groupdocs.com/annotation/java)We have been improving our APIs to meet the requirements of our customers. Therefore, we are pleased to announce Java Annotation API v17.10.3. In previous version of the API, there was a issue in importing annotations from PDF. But now this issue has been fixed in this [release](https://docs.groupdocs.com/display/annotationjava/GroupDocs.Annotation+for+Java+17.10.3+Release+Notes). We therefore recommend you to download this [latest](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/annotation/java) release for a better API experience.
