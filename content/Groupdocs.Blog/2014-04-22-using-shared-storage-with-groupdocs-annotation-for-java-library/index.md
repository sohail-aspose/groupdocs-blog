Today I'd like to show you how to store and open files from a shared folder within your network using the GroupDocs.Annotation for Java library. For those of you who are not familiar with the library yet, it's basically a web-based document viewer that comes with a comprehensive set of annotation tools. The library allows end users to comment on and mark up **almost 50 types** of documents from within your Java app. For more details on the library, please see [this page](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-annotation-library). If you or your client have a private collaboration network and want to use a shared folder for storing the annotated documents, this article is for you. It will guide you through using the [GroupDocs.Annotation for Java](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-annotation-library) library with a network storage within your Windows and Linux environments.
