##### Upcoming .NET API to classify your documents or text with IAB-2 or document taxonomies

The GroupDocs.Classification for .NET is going to be launched very soon. All you will have to do is integrate a DLL in your application and start document or text classification. As this will be a back-end API, you can implement it in your web, console or desktop applications. [Read more details here](https://blog.groupdocs.com/2019/11/13/upcoming-release-of-groupdocs.classification-for-.net/?utm_source=nl&utm_campaign=nl-dec19&utm_medium=link).

##### Search text or image signatures from documents in .NET with GroupDocs.Signature

Sometimes you need to scan a document to search if it is signed with a particular text or image. The manual inspection of the whole document or a bunch of documents is not an efficient way. To deal with such a case, we have introduced the feature of searching text or image signatures. [Read more details here](https://blog.groupdocs.com/2019/11/13/search-text-or-image-signatures-in-documents-using-groupdocs-signature-for-net/?utm_source=nl&utm_campaign=nl-dec19&utm_medium=link).

##### Insert links dynamically with GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET

Hyperlinks in the documents prove to be useful in many cases, for example, adding links to bookmarks in Word documents, adding links to slides within PowerPoint presentations, inserting a link to cell (or a range of cells) in Excel spreadsheets, etc. Therefore, to handle the hyperlinks in the document automation process, please [visit this article](https://blog.groupdocs.com/2019/11/26/net-java-document-assembly-api-for-dynamic-insertion-of-hyperlinks/?utm_source=nl&utm_campaign=nl-dec19&utm_medium=link).

##### Add watermarks to password protected documents in .NET

GroupDocs.Watermark already supports adding watermarks to the password protected documents, however, we have further improved and simplified the usage of this feature. Please [visit this article](https://blog.groupdocs.com/2019/11/22/watermark-password-protected-documents-using-groupdocs-watermark-net-api/?utm_source=nl&utm_campaign=nl-dec19&utm_medium=link) to get an insight.

##### .NET code example: Build your full text search solution in C#

Full text search is basically a more advanced way to search a text/query over a collection of documents in a computer. This approach quickly finds all instances of a term and it works by using text indexes. One of the examples of full text search implementation is in Word processors and text editors. It helps you find a phrase or word anywhere in the document. [Read more details here](https://blog.groupdocs.com/2019/11/22/build-your-full-text-search-solution-in-csharp/?utm_source=nl&utm_campaign=nl-dec19&utm_medium=link).
