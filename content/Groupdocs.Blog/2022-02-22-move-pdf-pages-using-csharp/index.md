In this digital era, PDF is one of the most used file formats and is popular due to its portability. On the other hand, most of the time we can not edit the PDF files. When we merge multiple documents and pages together to form a combined comprehensive document, it often happens that we finish combining the pages in the wrong order. This article discusses, **how to rearrange PDF pages programmatically using C#**.

## .NET API to Rearrange PDF Pages & Merge Documents

In order to rearrange pages in documents, GroupDocs provides [GroupDocs.Merger for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/net/). The API enables removing, splitting, and extraction of pages, changes in page orientation, and rotation of document pages within .NET applications. For the details and other features of the API, you can visit the [documentation](https://docs.groupdocs.com/merger/net/).

You can download the **DLLs** or **MSI** installer from the [downloads section](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/merger) or install the API in your .NET application via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/groupdocs.merger).

```
PM> Install-Package GroupDocs.Merger
```

## Rearrange PDF Pages using C#

The following are the steps that reorder the pages of PDF documents using C#.

*   Define the existing and new position of the page in [MoveOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger.domain.options/moveoptions) class.
*   Load the PDF document using the [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger) class.
*   Use [MovePage()](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/movepage) method to reorder according to defined options.
*   Save the PDF file with the new page order using the [Save()](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/net/groupdocs.merger/merger/methods/save/index) method.

The following C# code rearranges the pages of PDF documents. Precisely, it moves the 6th page of the document to the 1st place.
