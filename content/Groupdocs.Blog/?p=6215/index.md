[![GroupDocs.Viewer for Java](http://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/GD_VWR_JavaIcon_1141.png)](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/java)Today we’re pleased to announce the release of a new version of the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java library – 2.13.0. In this release we improved handling of documents in the **[OpenDocument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument)** formats. These include spreadsheets (ODS), word processing files (ODT) and presentations (ODP) when they are displayed using the HTML-based rendering mode. We also added a new **customDocumentCss** parameter for the **div.gdvimg** tag, which allows you to configure image styles (CSS), such as centering against the widget window, or adding image borders, when displaying TIFF, JPEG, PNG, GIF or BMP files using the HTML-based rendering mode. For more details on this parameter, please see [this page](https://docs.groupdocs.com/display/viewerjava/Release+Notes). Other improvements include increased overall performance of the viewer and improved structure, which prevents any possible conflicts with external libraries.
