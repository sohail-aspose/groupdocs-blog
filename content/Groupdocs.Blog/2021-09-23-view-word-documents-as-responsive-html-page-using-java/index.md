## Java API - Convert & View Word Docs as Responsive HTML {#responsive-html-view-java-api}

GroupDocs.Viewer provides the Java API to render the Word documents as responsive HTML pages within Java applications. This Java API allows to render, display, and manipulate a [large number of different document formats](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/supported-document-formats/). It further allows building **HTML Viewer** with external as well as embedded resources, an **Image Viewer** by rendering as JPG and PNG, and also the **PDF Viewer** that could be best for printing or sharing with others.

### Download or Configure

You may download the **JAR** file from the [downloads section](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/viewer), or just get the latest repository and dependency configurations for the pox.xml of your **maven-based** Java applications.

## Convert Word Documents to View as Responsive HTML using Java {#word-to-html-responsive}

You can render your MS Word DOC, DOCX documents, to responsive HTML pages to look good on all the different screen sizes. The following steps show how to convert a Word document (DOC/DOCX) to responsive HTML in Java.

*   Load the Word document (DOC/DOCX) using the [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer) class.
*   Set either the embedded or external resources for the html output using [HtmlViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/HtmlViewOptions).
*   Enable the responsive rendering using [setRenderResponsive](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/HtmlViewOptions#setRenderResponsive(boolean)) method.
*   To generate the responsive webpages of the loaded Word document, use the [view](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer#view(com.groupdocs.viewer.options.ViewOptions)) method of the Viewer class

The following source code renders the Word document as responsive HTML with embedded resources in Java.
