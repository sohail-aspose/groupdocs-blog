![](http://joomla-groupdocs.dynabic.com/templates/groupdocs/images/product-logos/90x90/groupdocs-viewer-java.png?v2)We are excited to announced another release of [Servlets front-end of GroupDocs.Viewer for Java](https://github.com/groupdocs-viewer/) scheduled this November. The release comes with improvements and fixes. We recommend to download and try the latest version. [GroupDocs.Viewer for Java](http://www.groupdocs.com/products/viewer/java) API allow us to render a wide range of documents into HTML, SVG and images to view them on any platform. The Servlets front-end is an example application to let you learn how to use the API in your own implementations.

## Better HTML renderingHTML rendering is integral part of our API and has been implemented in our Java front-ends from the beginning. This release further improves the rendering and fixes some formatting issues.
