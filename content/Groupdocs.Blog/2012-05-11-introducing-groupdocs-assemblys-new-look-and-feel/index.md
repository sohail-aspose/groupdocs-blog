We're continuing work on the new and improved GroupDocs look and feel. We're told you that [we're making changes to the GroupDocs dashboard and GroupDocs Viewer](https://blog.groupdocs.com/introducing-new-dashboard-and-online-document-viewer-ui "Introducing the new GroupDocs dashboard and document viewer"), and [we're also changing GroupDocs Annotation](https://blog.groupdocs.com/announcing-new-features-of-the-groupdocs-annotation-app "Document collaboration – introducing the new look GroupDocs Annotation"). We're not stopping there. We're also making changes to **GroupDocs Assembly**. **GroupDocs Assembly** is an app that lets you automate [document assembly](http://groupdocs.com/apps/assembly "document assembly") and automation. Think of your document as a form that you can use to create several new documents from. You start with a template document. In the template, there are a number of fields that will collect information, for example, name, address, date. (These are straightforward examples but you can use GroupDocs Assembly to create really sophisticated forms and collect all kinds of data.) In GroupDocs Assembly, associate questions with the different fields. We call this "creating a questionnaire". When you send the document out, the recipient answer the questions. When all questions have been answered - when the questionnaire is complete - a new document is created. The new document looks like the template but contains all the information that the recipient provided. GroupDocs Assembly helps you set up documents that you can use again and again to collect information and generate unique documents. It's convenient, safe and quick. To make it easier to use, we're improving the interface and adding a workflow to help lead you through the assembly process.

## Easy-to-follow WorkflowThe assembly process follows the same path every time:

1.  Choose a template.
2.  Assign questions to fields.
3.  Build pages.
4.  Preview and test.

## Manage Questions and Preview the QuestionnaireAssigning questions is really easy. Each of the variables are listed and you simply type a question for each. \[caption id="attachment\_308" align="aligncenter" width="650" caption="Assign questions to fields to help recipients complete the questionnaire."\]![Assign questions to fields to help recipients complete the questionnaire.

## Familiar Drag and DropGroupDocs Assembly, like [GroupDocs Annotate](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation), benefit from the changes we're making to the GroupDocs dashboard. You'll recognise the drop files area, for example. Drop templates there to upload them in an instant.   \[caption id="attachment\_296" align="aligncenter" width="544" caption="You'll recognise the drag and drop area from the new GroupDocs dashboard."\]![You'll recognise the drag and drop area from the new GroupDocs dashboard.](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/05/assembly-dashboard_drop-files.png "You'll recognise the drag and drop area from the new GroupDocs dashboard.")\[/caption\]
