In our last newsletter, we shared we were busy re-designing the whole GroupDocs UI and experience. We're very excited to share that these changes have been made: GroupDocs has a host of updated features and a new, vastly improved look & feel. We hope you like it. We've successfully implemented the user feedback we've received to date and look forward to hearing what you think of the changes: we're always listening to your requests.
