## Java API to Rearrange PDF Pages & Merge Documents

GroupDocs provides [GroupDocs.Merger for Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/merger/java/) to change the order of pages in documents. This API enables merging multiple documents, removing, splitting, and extraction of pages, rotation, and changes in page orientation of document pages within the applications. For the details and other features of the API, you can visit the [documentation](https://docs.groupdocs.com/merger/java/).

### Download and Configure

Get the library from the [downloads](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/merger/) section. For your Maven-based Java application, just add the following pom.xml configuration. After this, you can try the examples of this article as well the many more example available on [GitHub](https://github.com/groupdocs-merger). For the details, you may visit the [API Reference](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/java).

## Rearrange PDF Pages in Java

The following are the steps that help you change the sequence of PDF document pages in Java.

*   Define the existing and new position of the page in [MoveOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger.domain.options/MoveOptions) class.
*   Load the PDF document using the [Merger](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/merger/java/com.groupdocs.merger/Merger) class.
*   Use the **movePage()** method to rearrange pages according to defined options.
*   Save the reordered PDF file using the **save()** method.

The following Java source code rearranges the pages of PDF documents. Precisely, it moves the 6th page of the document to the 1st place.

## Conclusion

To conclude, we learned to reorder documents by changing the page sequence of the PDF files in Java within the application. We have seen the running example that changes the position of the page. You can try building a simple application that can organize the PDF files by easily shuffling their pages.
