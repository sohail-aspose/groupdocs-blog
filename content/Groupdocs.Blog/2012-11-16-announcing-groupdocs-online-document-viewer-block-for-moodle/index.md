We are excited to introduce the GroupDocs.Viewer block for Moodle CMS. With this block installed, you can embed GroupDocs' [online document viewer widget](http://groupdocs.com/apps/viewer) into Moodle webpages to display PDF, Microsoft Office and other common document types on your website. You Moodle website visitors can then view documents online directly on your website. What is important, end users don’t have to install any software. Documents embedded to your website with GroupDocs.Viewer can be viewed using any standard web-browser. \[caption id="attachment\_1069" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Announcing GroupDocs' online document viewer block for Moodle"\]![Announcing GroupDocs' online document viewer block for Moodle](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/11/Announcing-GroupDocs-online-document-viewer-block-for-Moodle.png)\[/caption\] One of the key GroupDocs.Viewer’s benefits is that it's platform and software independent. This helps you tackle cross-platform and cross-version compatibility issues. With GroupDocs.Viewer, you don't have to worry about what operating system or software your website visitors use.
