Hello everyone! We are back with another exciting release announcement. In this post, I am going to give you an overview of what's new as well as what's improved and fixed in the latest release of [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/net). In this release, we majorly focused on providing bug fixes and improvements. Along with this, we have introduced the support of **CDR** file format and the feature of rendering files contained in the ZIP archives. For details, you may also have look at the [release notes](https://docs.groupdocs.com/display/viewernet/GroupDocs.Viewer+for+.NET+19.4+Release+Notes).

First, let's have a walk through the new features that we introduced in the latest release.

## Support of CDR File Format

We have added the support of **CDR** file format that is a vector graphics file to store the images and it is used by **CorelDRAW** software.

## Getting and Rendering Files from ZIP Archives

In the [previous blog](https://blog.groupdocs.com/2019/03/30/groupdocs.viewer-for-.net-19.3-is-released/), we demonstrated how you can get the list of files, folders and the subfolders enclosed in a ZIP archive. Now, its time to go one step ahead and render the files contained in the ZIP archives. With the latest release, you can get the files located in the root as well as in a folder of the archive. The following code snippet shows how we can get and then render the files as attachments from an archive.
