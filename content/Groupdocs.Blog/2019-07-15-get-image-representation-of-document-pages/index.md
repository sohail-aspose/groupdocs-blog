Getting image representation of document pages is one of the most successful feature that is already implemented in .NET version of the API. Keeping your interest in view, we've now implemented this feature for Java developers. GroupDocs.Comparison for Java [19.6](https://docs.groupdocs.com/display/comparisonjava/GroupDocs.Comparison+for+Java+19.6+Release+Notes) allows you to save document comparison results in image format as well.  
**What does it take to implement such a feature?**  
You just have to pass the output folder path to _convertToImages_ method and API will take care of conversion mechanism itself.  
Let's have a look at the implementation:
