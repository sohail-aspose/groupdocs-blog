Online document management has gained wide industry acceptance in the last few years. From version control, central document repositories, cost reduction, and increasing employee output: cloud technologies helps. One of the tasks we often perform in our work is to compare documents or files to find differences and check which version is the most recent. That can be frustrating at times: it is time consuming and takes time that could be used for other tasks. Consider the example of a software engineer who needs to review and spot the differences in two Javascript or PHP files. Checking lines of code manually is error-prone and the engineer may miss important details. In this scenario, there should be a mechanism that can highlight the differences real-time and provide a summary on additions or deletions made in the files. \[caption id="attachment\_4112" align="alignnone" width="622" caption="How Lawyers and Legal Firms Benefit from GroupDocs Comparison"\]![](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/10/GD_Blog_Lawyers.png "How Lawyers and Legal Firms Benefit from GroupDocs Comparison ")\[/caption\] Whether you need to compare Word documents, Excel spreadsheets or PDF files – [GroupDocs Comparison](http://groupdocs.com/apps/comparison) is here to help you.
