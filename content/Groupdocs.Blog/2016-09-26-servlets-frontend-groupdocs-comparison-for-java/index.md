![](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/09/java-comparison-logo.png)Document comparison is a process of finding differences in two documents of same format. It can be a content difference or can be any contextual differences. [GroupDocs.Comparison for Java](http://www.groupdocs.com/java/document-conversion-library) compares a source document with a target document and produces a result document which highlights the differences in a suitable way i.e. colored highlighting or by differing font information that has either been added to or removed from the reference document to produce the target document.

Common document formats for comparison include word processing documents (like Microsoft Word), spreadsheets (like Microsoft Excel), presentations (e.g. PowerPoint), and Portable Document Format (PDF) documents.
