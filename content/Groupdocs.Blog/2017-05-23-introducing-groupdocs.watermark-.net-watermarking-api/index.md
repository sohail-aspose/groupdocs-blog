[![GroupDocs Watermark for .NET](http://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/05/GroupDocs-Watermark-for-.NET_.png)](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-watermark-library)

We are excited to release [GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET](https://www.groupdocs.com/products/watermark/net) API that makes it simple to perform watermarking operations in various document and image formats. The API facilitates you with simple syntax, easy to use methods and a few lines of code to perform any watermarking operation. Using GroupDocs.Watermark, you can add, search, and remove watermark from many popular document and image formats. Continue to read more about the API's features.

## Why GroupDocs.Watermark Is Developed?Watermarking is a technique to indicate that the document is confidential and contains some sensitive information/data. In many instances, some documents are to be shared among all the stakeholders and partners within a company. In this case, GroupDocs.Watermark can be used to apply the watermark to all the documents to symbolize the sensitivity of the information and to discourage any unauthorized and unaccredited sharing.

## Example Business CasesFor instance, there might be the case that a company has changed its name and logo and most of the working documents still contain the watermark with old name and logo. In this case, if the CEO wants to remove the watermark from the documents, GroupDocs.Watermark will be helpful. In order to elaborate real life needs, we have envisaged some real life cases.
