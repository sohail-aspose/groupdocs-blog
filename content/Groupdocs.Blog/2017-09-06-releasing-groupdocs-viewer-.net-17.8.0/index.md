[![GroupDocs Viewer for .NET](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/11/groupdocs-viewer-net.png)](https://www.groupdocs.com/products/viewer/net)

Another month, another version. Today we are releasing version 17.8.0 of [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://www.groupdocs.com/products/viewer/net). This version resolves a number of bugs that were found in prior releases. Furthermore, we have added the support of more file formats as well as introduced new features in this monthly release. Please continue to find out more about version 17.8.0.

## Rendering Documents with Comments {#GroupDocs.Viewerfor.NET17.8.0ReleaseNotes-RenderingdocumentswithComments}From version 17.8.0, we have extended the support of rendering document comments. Now, rendering comments into HTML and PDF is supported for Microsoft Power Point. Furthermore, rendering comments into HTML is supported for MS Excel and OpenDocument spreadsheet. For more details on rendering documents with comments, please visit [this documentation article](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net "GroupDocs.Viewer features").

## Ignoring Empty Rows when Rendering Cells Documents {#GroupDocs.Viewerfor.NET17.8.0ReleaseNotes-IgnoringemptyrowswhenrenderingCellsdocuments}Sometimes Cells document contains information in the beginning of the worksheet and after that, it contains some count of empty (blank) rows and information again e.g. summary row. Rendering complete worksheet may take considerable time and may result in decreased performance. Starting from 17.8.0, we introduced a new option, _CellsOptions.IgnoreEmptyRows,_ which allows omitting rendering of empty rows. For more details, please visit [this documentation article](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net "GroupDocs.Viewer features").

## Responsive Output for Rendering into HTML {#GroupDocs.Viewerfor.NET17.8.0ReleaseNotes-ResponsiveoutputforrenderingintoHTML}In order to make your rendering into HTML look well across all type of devices, we added _EnableResponsiveRendering _option of HtmlOptions class. For more details, please visit [this documentation article](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net "GroupDocs.Viewer features").

## Ignoring Resource Prefix for HTML Resources {#GroupDocs.Viewerfor.NET17.8.0ReleaseNotes-IgnoringresourceprefixforHTMLresources}Since the version 17.8.0, _IgnoreResourcePrefixForCss_ setting is marked as obsolete and has been replaced by _IgnorePrefixInResources_ which applies to all resource types.

*   DNG - Image file format
