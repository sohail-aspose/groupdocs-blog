[![GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET Logo](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/07/GD_CMP_NETIcon_1141.png)](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-comparison-library)[GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-comparison-library) is a downloadable library designed to let developers seamlessly add multi-format document comparison functionality to their own applications or 3rd party services. It allows end users to compare two versions of a document in a web-browser without having to install original software used to create the documents. Supported file formats include: PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, plain text, HTML and ODT. Today we’re pleased to announce the release of a plugin that allows developers to integrate GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET into SharePoint. When installed, end users will be able to compare two versions of a document directly from within your SharePoint environment. Key features include: **Multiple File Types Support:** PDF, DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, PPT/PPTX, TXT, HTML, ODT. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** end users can compare documents from any web-enabled device using any standard web-browser, including: Internet Explorer 8+, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari 5+. **Easy deployment:** there is no need to install any software or browser plugins on the client side. **Convenient User Interface:** GroupDocs.Comparison visualizes differences found between two documents using a redline “Track Changes” view approach, which should be familiar to Microsoft Word users. The UI also provides end users with a comprehensive set of controls, which makes it easy to navigate documents and review changes in a web-browser. **Advanced support for Microsoft Word documents:** when comparing Microsoft Word documents, users can accept or reject found differences and then merge the compared documents into a final file.
