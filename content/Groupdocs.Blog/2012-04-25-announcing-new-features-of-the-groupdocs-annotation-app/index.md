[GroupDocs Annotation](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation) is a web-based app that allows users to annotate PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents online, from a web-browser. With this app, you and your colleagues and partners can review and annotate a document simultaneously, in real time. We're constantly working to improve the app's interface and would like to introduce a new set of features we've recently designed and implemented.

## Add and Manage NotesGroupDocs Annotation lets you add notes throughout a document which show up as numbered markers. Hover the cursor over a marker to see the comment or click a marker sign on the right-hand side to go straight to the comment. \[caption id="attachment\_245" align="aligncenter" width="650" caption="GroupDocs Annotation - UI"\]![GroupDocs Annotation - UI](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/04/annotate_comments-no-rollover_callouts.png "GroupDocs Annotation - UI")\[/caption\]

## Familiar Editing ToolsWe've added a set of new annotation tools and improved the existing ones. Now it is even easier to add notes to a document, wherever you want. With the new Area Notes and Polyline tools, you can easily highlight an area in a document. You may also find useful the new options that allows you to strike out text and add new text sections. \[caption id="attachment\_246" align="aligncenter" width="526" caption="GroupDocs Annotation - Toolbar"\]![GroupDocs Annotation - Toolbar](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/04/annotate_toolbar.png "GroupDocs Annotation - Toolbar")\[/caption\]

## Work with ImagesGood news for design teams. From now, GroupDocs Annotation allows you to upload, share and annotate images of all common formats. This way you can conveniently review and collaborate on sketches, mockups and complex designs with your team members in real time. \[caption id="attachment\_248" align="aligncenter" width="650" caption="GroupDocs Annotation - Annotate PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint Documents"\]![GroupDocs Annotation - Annotate PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint Documents](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/04/annotate_view-document-comments.png "GroupDocs Annotation - Annotate PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint Documents")\[/caption\]   \[caption id="attachment\_249" align="aligncenter" width="650" caption="GroupDocs Annotation - Annotate Images"\]![GroupDocs Annotation - Annotate Images](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/04/annotatw_view-graphic-comments.png "GroupDocs Annotation - Annotate Images")\[/caption\]
