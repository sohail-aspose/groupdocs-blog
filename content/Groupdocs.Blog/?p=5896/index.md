GroupDocs.Viewer: Burn in Watermarks to Protect the Documents You Share

Not a long time ago, we’ve implemented an ability to share documents in a PDF format. When enabled, viewers can download only a PDF copy of your original document. Today, we’re pleased to announce an enhancement to this feature.

Starting from version 2.8.0, you can set GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET to burn in custom watermarks to PDF copies of shared documents, while your original documents stored on the server stay intact.

Product News

**New and Coming Soon to GroupDocs.Signature for .NET**

In the latest release we've implemented a capability of verifying unique reference IDs applied to signed documents. This allows you to control whether a document was actually signed using the GroupDocs.Signature interface / library, or via some other application or tool. Here is how this works:

1\. A unique reference ID is generated automatically upon signing a document. The ID is burned into the signed document as metadata and also streamed to your server using the sign method, so that you can save it.

2\. Once you receive a signed document, you can verify whether the document was signed using the GroupDocs.Signature interface by checking your saved reference IDs with one in the document’s metadata.

As you may already know, GroupDocs.Signature can be used either programmatically, as a document e-signature engine, or in conjunction with an out-of-the-box UI that comes with the library. In case you use it as a pure engine, the reference ID is returned by the sign method. And when using the library along with the in-built UI, the reference ID is also saved to a database for the corresponding document.
