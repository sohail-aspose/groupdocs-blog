## Challenge

We have been looking for a generic document viewer that we can OEM and use within our Correspondence Management System. The development team consists of 5 developers for implementing the new Correspondence Management System.

We are in the process to upgrade our solution in 5 customers with an average of 200 users in each customer.

## Strategy

### Finding a Solution

We evaluated more than 5 products and compare their technology, supported document formats, features, Arabic support, and licensing schemes. Our team selected the GroupDocs suite from Aspose as we need more features than viewing documents.

### Implementation

The solution took 12 months in the development. The challenges were minor as we have been working in the same field for years and the integration with GroupDocs and other third parties was straightforward. In some cases, we needed support from the GroupDocs team and we got the needed support on the timeframe. 

## Result

The outcome of our implementation is having state of the art modern Correspondence Management System that can manage and handle all types of the required documents.

## Next Steps

We are planning to deploy the solutions in the government agencies in GCC.

## Summary

The target objectives and features were achieved, GroupDocs API saved the time and the efforts for our team and minimized the required investments for the company.

Based on the above, we highly recommend the Aspose [GroupDocs Suite of APIs](https://products.groupdocs.com/), productive, easy to use, flexible and above all affordable.
