From The Library

**Work with password protected documents in GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET**

Specific document types, in particular Adobe PDF and the family of Microsoft Office documents (Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) can be encrypted and password protected, thus restricting the viewing capabilities of your audience.

[This documentation page](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net) shows you how you can view such documents. For the first time, support for encrypted PDF and Microsoft Word documents was introduced in GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET version 2.16. And in version 2.17 we’ve added support for password-protected Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint documents along with additional encryption-related features. If you have any issues or want to discuss the functionality, please talk to our Technical Support Team in our [Technical Support Forums](http://groupdocs.com/Community/Forums/Default.aspx).
