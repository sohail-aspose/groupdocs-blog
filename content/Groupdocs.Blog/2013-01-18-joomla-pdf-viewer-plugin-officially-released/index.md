Hello to all Joomla users! Here at GroupDocs, we're excited to announce the release of the long-awaited [PDF viewer plugin for Joomla CMS](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/plugins/viewer/joomla). The plugin allows you to easily embed and host PDF documents (as well as Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents) on your Joomla website. We've been working hard to make the installation process and plugin deployment hassle-free for Joomla web-developers and website owners. At the same time, our aim was to make the document viewer interface convenient for the end users - your website visitors. We think we've achieved that task by 200%. Let's now take a closer look at the key features and benefits of using our PDF viewer plugin on your Joomla website. ![Joomla PDF viewer plugin by GroupDocs](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/08/GD_Viewer_Plugin_for_Joomla.jpg)

## Joomla PDF Viewer Plugin - Key Features & Benefits**1\. No Flash or any web-browser plugins required.** Our PDF viewer plugin doesn't convert documents to images, and outperform all Flash-based viewers in both usability and reliability. Your website visitors don't need to install any web-browser plugins or Flash to view embedded documents. Any document can be viewed in any modern web-browser. **2\. Support for all common business document formats.** With the GroupDocs Viewer plugin for Joomla, you can embed and host not only PDF files, but also all common Microsoft Office documents, including word-processing documents (DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, ODT, etc.), Excel spreadsheets (XLS, XLSX, CSV, etc.) and PowerPoint presentations (PPT, PPTX). **3\. Real text documents, not images.** GroupDocs Viewer renders both PDF and Microsoft Office files as real text documents. This allows visitors, for example, to select and copy text right from the embedded document. And if you don't want users to copy text for some reason, you can easily restrict this feature. **4\. High quality rendering.** Thanks to native text rendering, hosted documents look just as the originals. Font styles, formatting and document layout always remain intact! **5\. Convenient navigation.** Apart from simple scrolling, users can turn pages with the Go Forward/Backward buttons, jump straight to a specified page and preview pages with thumbnails. We also supplied our document viewer with a search feature, which allows users to quickly find a text block in the document. **6\. Many other handy features.** There are many other features designed to make your website visitors delighted with the on-page document viewing experience. For example, users can zoom in to or out of documents for comfortable reading, use double-page flipping, download or print the original document right from a web-page, etc.
