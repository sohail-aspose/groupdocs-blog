### GroupDocs Cloud SDK for Your Programming LanguageTo help developers on different platforms and programming environments configure, customize and integrate GroupDocs’ document collaboration tools into any web/mobile application or site, we’ve developed SDKs that make it easy to call GroupDocs Cloud APIs. Currently we offer Cloud SDKs for .NET, Java, Python, Ruby, PHP and JavaScript. Recently we’ve released an update to GroupDocs.Total for Cloud API with over 20 minor improvements and bug fixes. In particular, we’ve improved handling of Google Picker file uploads, added the ability of requesting user account removal from the profile page, improved handling of DOC to DOCX conversion operations, streamlined the process of integrating GroupDocs with the Box cloud storage provider, implemented a number of GUI style fixes, etc. In conjunction with updated APIs, we’ve also released new SDK versions with the updated _UploadGoogle_ method (added parameters: url, description, accessToken; removed parameters: path, field), _StorageInfoResult_ class (added a new property - used\_documents) and a new method – _SetCreditCard_.
