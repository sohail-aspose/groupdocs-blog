![](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/03/GD_VWR_NETIcon_114.png)Good news for DNN users - we've recently released a [module](http://store.dnnsoftware.com/home/product-details/groupdocs-viewer-for-net-html5-document-viewer) which allows you to integrate GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET into DNN CMS. Using the module you can seamlessly embed our HTML5 document viewer into your DNN site and display over 45 types of documents and images on any web page. Different from our [cloud-based module](https://blog.groupdocs.com/), this version is developed based on the GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library, which means you can now store and process documents on your own servers. Existing users of the GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library can use the module for free. In case you don't have a license for the library yet, please [contact our sales](http://groupdocs.com/corporate/contact-us) for a free 30-day evaluation copy. For more information on the module and installation instructions, please visit [this page](http://store.dnnsoftware.com/home/product-details/groupdocs-viewer-for-net-html5-document-viewer) on the official DNN store.
