**GroupDocs.Viewer for Java: support for new file formats, plus enhanced API for custom cache configuration**

This month we’ve managed to release two new versions of the GroupDocs.Viewer for Java library - version 2.8.0 and 2.9.0. In these two releases we’ve added support for 5 new file formats, including: ICO, PSD, ODP, PPS and PPSX. Another major update – is the extended _CacheDataHandlerinterface_, which allows you to configure and manage custom caching rules. You can now control what data, how and when you’d like the viewer to cache on the server. For example, you can configure the library to add only encrypted data to cache and set your custom storage path. Please [read this guide](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/java) for details on how the interface works. In the version 2.9.0 we’ve also added support for hyperlinks in textual documents. For more details on these and numerous other improvements, please see release notes and download the latest version from the [downloads section of our website](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/9/java-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_java/entry5405.aspx).
