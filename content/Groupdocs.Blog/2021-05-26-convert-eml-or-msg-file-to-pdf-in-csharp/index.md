## .NET API for Email Conversion {#dotnet-email-conversion-library}

GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET is the API that allows the conversion of email messages to other formats. In this article, we will use that API for converting MSG and EML messages to PDF format using C#. Furthermore, the API allows the back and forth conversion of word-processing documents, spreadsheets, presentations, eBooks, images, and many other file formats within your .NET applications.

You can download the **DLLs** or **MSI** installer from the [downloads section](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/conversion) or install the API in your .NET application via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/groupdocs.conversion).

```
PM> Install-Package GroupDocs.Conversion
