# GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET - BugÂ  Fixes

At [GroupDocs](https://www.groupdocs.com/), we are always focused on delivering the best to our customers. In this regard we have fixed an issue related to removing EXIF geo-location which was resulting in the loss of XMP metadata. The latest release has resolved this issue and preserves the XMP metadata intact after a user [removes the EXIF geo-location](https://docs.groupdocs.com/metadata/net) from a JPEG image.
