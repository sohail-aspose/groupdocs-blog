The **GroupDocs dashboard** provides you with several features for organizing files and folders. The new dashboard is very user friendly, so you get familiar with it pretty quickly. In this post, we focus on the GroupDocs dashboard. I'm going to list some of GroupDocs dashboard's key features useful for [document management](http://groupdocs.com/ "online document management"): \[caption id="attachment\_402" align="alignnone" width="622" caption="Fig.1: GroupDocs dashboard helps you organise your files and folders for better document management"\]![GroupDocs dashboard helps you organise your files and folders for better document management](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/06/dasboard-with-call-outs-new12.png "GroupDocs dashboard helps you organise your files and folders for better document management")\[/caption\]
