Great news for all reviewers! We’ve introduced the new **GroupDocs Annotation** user interface to make your [document annotation process](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation) easier and faster. With these new enhanced UI and features, you are now able to annotate and collaborate on documents quickly. **GroupDocs Annotation** is a service that lets you perform document collaboration easily. You and your colleagues can annotate documents and perform document collaboration in real time. You can make suggestions or add the required comments online at the same time, which makes the review process much faster. However, if you prefer a more traditional approach like everyone takes their turn as per the availability, that works just fine as well.

## Annotate or perform document collaboration using the enhanced UIWe’re constantly enhancing the look and feel of our apps to add more advanced features to them. This way, we aim at improving user experience at **GroupDocs**. With this in mind, we’ve made necessary changes to our old Annotation UI and introduced a new improved UI with new efficient features to supplement it. \[caption id="attachment\_1145" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Annotate and collaborate on documents using GroupDocs Annotation"\]![Annotate and collaborate on documents using GroupDocs Annotation](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/12/Annotate-and-collaborate-on-documents-using-GroupDocs-Annotation.png)\[/caption\] In this enhanced version, you can find and access all comments in the comments area. You can view comment summary, comment details as well as the document collaboration option just right of your annotated page. Using the invite option, you can invite as many reviewers as required. All you need to do is just share the link directly or invite them through email. You can print, download or export the annotated document. You can export the annotated document with or without the added comments. Also, you can embed the annotated document to your website and invite others to perform document review on the document.

## Familiar annotation tools let you easily annotate documentsWe’ve retained the easy-to use annotate tools, such as Text Annotation, Point Annotation, Area Annotation, Polyline Annotation, and Strikeout Text. There is no need to explain about these tools as there are pretty self-explanatory. \[caption id="attachment\_1146" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Annotate documents using a familiar set of annotation tools"\]![Annotate documents using a familiar set of annotation tools](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/12/Annotate-documents-using-a-familiar-set-of-annotation-tools.png)\[/caption\]

## New FeaturesNewly added are the Typewriter tool and the Watermark tool. Typewriter tool lets you add text to a document. Watermark tool lets you add watermark to all pages of a document. This new watermark feature improves document security. \[caption id="attachment\_1165" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Newly added features spice up your annotation experience"\]![Newly added features spice up your annotation experience](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/12/Newly-added-features-spice-up-your-annotation-experience2.png)\[/caption\]
