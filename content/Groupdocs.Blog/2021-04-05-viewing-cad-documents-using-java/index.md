summary: '**C**omputer-**A**ided **D**esign - **CAD** files are normally used for 2D and 3D designs. These designs are generated by CAD software programs and are normally used to create models and architectural plans. If you have worked with CAD, you’re most likely familiar with some of AutoCAD’s file formats, such as **DWG, DXF, DGN, DWF**. This article will discuss how to programmatically view CAD files within Java applications.

The following topics are briefly covered in this article:

*   Java API to render CAD files.
*   Convert CAD files to render as HTML, JPG, PNG, or PDF in Java.
*   Get layouts and layers of DWG in Java.
*   Render CAD layers of DWG drawing in Java.
*   Render CAD layouts of DWG drawing in Java.

## Java API to Render CAD files - DWG, DXF, DWF, DGN {#java-api-to-render-cad-files}

[GroupDocs.Viewer for Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/java) is the API that allows rendering various documents and image files into HTML, Image, or PDF format to view these files within your Java application. The API supports [more than 100 file formats to programmatically render as HTML, JPG, PNG, or PDF](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/supported-document-formats/).

In this article, we will stick to the CAD files. In addition to the already mentioned **DWG** and **DGN** formats, you can further view AutoCAD formats such as **DWF, DWT, DXF, and also IFC, STL, IGS, CF2, Plotter document (PLT, HPG)** files within your java applications.

### Download and Configure

[Get the library](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/viewer/java) from downloads or just add the following pom.xml configuration in your Maven-based Java applications to try the below-mentioned examples. For the details, you may visit the [API Reference](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java).

## Convert CAD Drawings to Render as HTML, PNG, JPG, or PDF in Java {#convert-cad-to-html-jpg-jpg-pdf-in-java}

The API allows rendering the CAD documents to HTML, JPG, PNG, and PDF formats. In this article, I am sticking to the DWG format for the conversion and rendering to other formats using examples. To start with, let's convert the DWG design and render it as HTML with embedded as well as external resource options.

### Convert DWG to HTML with Embedded Resources

The following are the steps of how to convert the DWG file to render as HTML.

*   Initialize the [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer) class object using the source .dwg file.
*   Create [HtmlViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/HtmlViewOptions) using _[forEmbeddedResources](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/HtmlViewOptions#forEmbeddedResources())_ method.
*   Render .dwg to HTML using _[view](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer#view(com.groupdocs.viewer.options.ViewOptions))_ method.

The following source code converts the DWG file and renders it as HTML with embedded resources in Java.

### Convert DWG to HTML with External Resources

The following are the steps of how to convert the DWG file to render as HTML file(s) and with external resources.

*   Initialize the [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer) class object using the source .dwg file.
*   Create [HtmlViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/HtmlViewOptions) using [_forExternalResources_](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/HtmlViewOptions#forExternalResources()) method.
*   Render .dwg to HTML using _[view](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer#view(com.groupdocs.viewer.options.ViewOptions))_ method.

The following source code renders the DWG file as HTML with external resources in Java.

{{< gist GroupDocsGists 5e8817fee989916e595d86081578147c "ConvertDwgtoHtmlExtRes.java" >}}

### Convert DWG to PDF, JPG, and PNG in Java

Similar to the conversion to HTML format, DWG files can be rendered as PDF, JPG, and PNG format using the respective ViewOptions as follows:

*   [HtmlViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/HtmlViewOptions) to render as HTML
*   [JpgViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/JpgViewOptions) to render as JPG
*   [PngViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/PngViewOptions) to render as PNG
*   [PdfViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/PdfViewOptions) to render as PDF

## Get Layouts and Layers of DWG in Java {#get-layout-and-layers-of-dwg-in-java}

As CAD files may consist of multiple layouts and layers, you can easily get their layouts and layers using the following steps.

*   Instantiate the [ViewInfoOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/ViewInfoOptions) object for HTML rendering.
*   Using ViewInfoOptions, you can get the [CadViewInfo](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.results/CadViewInfo).
*   Get the layouts from viewInfo using _[getLayouts](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.results/CadViewInfo#getLayouts())_ method.
*   Get the layers from viewInfo using _[getLayers](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.results/CadViewInfo#getLayers())_ method.

The following code shows how to get all the layouts and layers of the DWG file using Java.

{{< gist GroupDocsGists 5e8817fee989916e595d86081578147c "GetDwgLayoutsAndLayers.java" >}}

## Render CAD Layers of DWG file in Java {#render-layers-of-dwg-in-java}

By default, all the layers of the CAD drawing get rendered as shown above. However, you can render any specific layer of DWG by selecting the chosen ones using the [_setLayers_](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/CadOptions#setLayers(java.util.List)) method of the Java API as shown below.

*   Initialize the [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer) class object using the source .dwg file.
*   Instantiate [HtmlViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/HtmlViewOptions).
*   Add the layer(s) to render using _[setLayers](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/CadOptions#setLayers(java.util.List))_ method of CadOptions.
*   Render .dwg to HTML using _[view](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer#view(com.groupdocs.viewer.options.ViewOptions))_ method.

The following code renders the layers of a CAD file of DWG format in Java.

{{< gist GroupDocsGists 5e8817fee989916e595d86081578147c "RenderCadLayers.java" >}}

## Render CAD Layouts of DWG file in Java {#render-layouts-of-dwg-in-java}

When we render the CAD drawing, we only get the model presentation by default. To render the model as well as all the non-empty layouts, we just have to set the **RenderLayout** property of CadOptions as true.

*   Initialize the [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer) class object using the source .dwg file.
*   Instantiate [HtmlViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/HtmlViewOptions).
*   Set the [RenderLayout](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/CadOptions#setRenderLayouts(boolean)) property of CadOptions to true.
*   Render .dwg as HTML using _[view](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer#view(com.groupdocs.viewer.options.ViewOptions))_ method.

The following code renders all the non-empty layouts along with the model of a CAD drawing with DWG format in Java.
