We're about to launch a new interface for the GroupDocs Dashboard and our [online document viewer app](http://groupdocs.com/apps/viewer). We have overhauled the look and feel of the tools to make them more intuitive to use. At the moment, we're adding the final touches and making sure that everything works fine. The changes will be live in the next few weeks. Here's what will change when the new interface goes live: **Dashboard interface:**

*   Easier navigation thanks to added breadcrumbs;
*   All applications will be available from the Dashboard menu;
*   Drag and drop interface - allows you to easily upload documents;
*   Document sorting options - allows you to find documents quickly.

**Online document viewer interface:**

*   Improved look and feel;
*   Easier navigation.

## Easier Document Management with the New DashboardGroupDocs is mainly used by small and medium companies as an [online document management solution](http://groupdocs.com/). We value your time and always work on interface improvements to make it intuitive and easy to use. We're about to change the dashboard and the online document viewer, so that you will be able to:

*   See who your documents are shared with;
*   See when they were last modified;
*   See their size, file format and name;
*   Convert document easily and quickly;
*   Upload documents by simply dropping them onto the drop files area.

## Easier navigationWe've added a breadcrumb trail to the GroupDocs Dashboard so that it is easier to navigate your folders. You can now click on a folder in the breadcrumb trail to go to it directly. \[caption id="attachment\_160" align="aligncenter" width="307" caption="GroupDocs Dashboard - Breadcrumb trail"\]![UGroupDocs Dashboard - Breadcrumb trail](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/04/new-dash_navigation.png "GroupDocs Dashboard - Breadcrumb trail")\[/caption\]

## Drag and Drop to Upload DocumentsTo upload documents, simply drag and drop them onto the Drop Files area in the GroupDocs Dashboard. The files are automatically uploaded to the current folder. \[caption id="attachment\_167" align="aligncenter" width="650" caption="GroupDocs Dashboard - Drag and drop interface"\]![GroupDocs Dashboard - Drag and drop interface](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/04/new-dash_drop-files_final.png "GroupDocs Dashboard - Drag and drop interface")\[/caption\] 

## Sort DocumentsOrganize your documents the way that suits you best by sorting them. By default, files are sorted in alphabetical order. You can change the order they are listed in by clicking column headers.

## Improved Interface of the Online Document Viewer AppThe new interface of GroupDocs' online document viewer app makes it easier to navigate a document. We've added a thumbnails feature, so that you can quickly move from one page to another. Also, you can now quickly access a set of handy tools that allow you to work with the document online. \[caption id="attachment\_290" align="aligncenter" width="650" caption="Improved interface of the online document viewer"\]![Improved Interface of the Online Document Viewer App](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/04/new-dash_viewer_3.png "Improved Interface of the Online Document Viewer App")\[/caption\]
