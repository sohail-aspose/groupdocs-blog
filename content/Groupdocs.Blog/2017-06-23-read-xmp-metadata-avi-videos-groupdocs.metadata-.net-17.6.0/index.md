![](http://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/06/groupdocs-metadata-net.png "GroupDocs-Metadata-theme-100x100")Team GroupDocs is really pleased to announce the release of **[GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET version 17.6.0](http://www.groupdocs.com/products/metadata/net "GroupDocs.Metadata")**. Four new features and a bug fix are introduced in this regular monthly release of the API. The latest version of the API has focused mainly on adding features related to the image format. It now allows reading maker notes in JPEG images along with providing the ability to parse additional IFD tags like SByte, SShort, SRational and SLong in supported image formats.
