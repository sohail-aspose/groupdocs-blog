[![Document Viewer API](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/11/groupdocs-viewer-net.png)](https://www.groupdocs.com/products/viewer/net)

We are pleased to announce the monthly release of [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/net) **18.12**. This release includes three new features, two bug fixes, and four improvements. By upgrading to the latest version, you'll be able to get the list of folders and render messages from a specific folder contained in Outlook Data Files (**OST/PST**). Furthermore, it also allows you to ignore empty columns when rendering Excel documents. Below is the list of new features, fixes, and the improvements added in version 18.12.

# Features Introduced

## Working with Folders Contained in OST/PST FormatsGroupDocs.Viewer now also allows you to deal with the folders and the sub-folders in Outlook Data File documents (**OST/PST**). You can retrieve the list of the folders contained by a document and render the messages from a specific folder or the sub-folder such as Inbox, Sent Items, Deleted, Inbox\\Sub\_Folder\_1 etc. This feature is available for rendering the document into HTML, image, and PDF. For working examples, please visit the following documentation articles:

*   [Retrieving the List of Outlook Folders](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net)
*   [Rendering Messages from Specified Folder](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net)

## Ignoring Empty Columns in Excel DocumentsSometimes Excel worksheet contains the empty columns along with the columns populated with data. In this case, if the number of empty columns is considerably huge, the rendering time increases and hence, it affects the performance. For such cases, we have introduced a new feature that ignores the empty columns using **_CellsOptions.IgnoreEmptyColumns_** property. For a working example, please visit [this](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net) documentation article.

# Improvements

We have included the following improvements in version 18.12:

*   Ignore empty string when it is passed as path to directory with fonts
*   Improve rendering into HTML for Outlook Data Files with subfolders and empty folders
*   Set exception localization feature as obsolete
*   Prevent rendering frozen and invisible CAD layers by default
