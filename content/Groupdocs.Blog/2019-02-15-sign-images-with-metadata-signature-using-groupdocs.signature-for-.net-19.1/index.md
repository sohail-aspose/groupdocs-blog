[![GroupDocs.Signature](http://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/07/groupdocs-signature-net.png)](https://www.groupdocs.com/products/signature/net)New month, new release! We have released version 19.1 of [GroupDocs.Signature for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/signature/net) that brings a couple of new features as well as two bug fixes and two improvements. The latest version provides metadata signature features for image files. Furthermore, the API now supports rounded corners for rectangle stamp signature types. For more details on what's new in the latest release, please have a look at [release notes](https://docs.groupdocs.com/display/signaturenet/GroupDocs.Signature+for+.NET+19.1+Release+Notes).

# Features Introduced

## Metadata Signature Features for ImagesIn the latest version, we have introduced a new feature of singing images with metadata signatures that are based on Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF) specification. For this, we have added a new public class **ImageMetadataSignatureOptions** that provides different options to add metadata signatures in images. For a working example, please visit [this](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/net) documentation article.

## Rounded Corners for Stamp SignaturesA new public class **SquareBorderLine** that inherits **BorderLine** is added to implement square stamp signature with rounded corners. This class contains data about the radius of the square signature's corners. For a working example, please visit [this](https://docs.groupdocs.com/signature/net) documentation article.
