Contao users have a reason to smile. Our team is happy to announce the launch of [GroupDocs' Annotation plugin for Contao](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/plugins/annotation/contao). Our document annotation app, GroupDocs Annotation, is popular with our users because it lets them annotate most popular file formats. Annotate PDF, word processing documents and images from a web-browser. [GroupDocs Annotation](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation) lets you mark up documents, share feedback, discuss ideas and expedite the document review cycle. Invite colleagues for document review. Your colleagues can choose from a set of annotation options to add comments. This way, GroupDocs Annotation facilitates collaboration between team members. All members of a team can see comments or suggestion made by others. Information publishers then consolidate the feedback saved in a single file and publish the document. So save time, increase productivity, and make document collaboration simpler. \[caption id="attachment\_3823" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="PDF Annotation Module for Contao Is Released"\]![PDF Annotation Module for Contao Is Released](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/09/GD_Blog_ANN_02.png "PDF Annotation Module for Contao Is Released")\[/caption\]
