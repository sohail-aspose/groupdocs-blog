[![GroupDocs.Annotation for Java icon](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/04/GroupDocs.Annotation-for-Java.png "GroupDocs.Annotation for Java")](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-annotation-library) Good news for **Alfresco users**! Recently we released a [Java version of the GroupDocs.Annotation library](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-annotation-library "Annotate Documents from Your Java App"). It allows developers to enhance their Java web and mobile applications with **document annotation capabilities**. Today, we're pleased to inform you that we've recently released an add-on for Alfresco Share based on the library. **Alfresco** is a platform that helps organizations manage their content. It allows users to store, organize and share any type of content. Alfresco Share, in particular, is a web-based platform that provides content management tools (for example wiki, blog, file explorer, etc.). The newly released add-on integrates GroupDocs' annotation capabilities into the Alfresco Share document management web shell. So, starting from now, among other tools in your Alfresco Share instance, you can turn on and use the **GroupDocs.Annotation** for Java library and enhance **document collaboration** workflows in your company. To get the add-on installed and configured quickly, please see a [detailed deployment guide](http://groupdocs.com/docs/display/annotationjava/Integrating+GroupDocs.Annotation+for+Java+Plugin+with+Alfresco#IntegratingGroupDocs.AnnotationforJavaPluginwithAlfresco-controller "Integrating GroupDocs.Annotation for Java Plugin with Alfresco").
