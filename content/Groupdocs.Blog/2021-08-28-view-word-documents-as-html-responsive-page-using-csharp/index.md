## .NET API for Word and Responsive HTML Viewer {#html-viewer-dotnet-api}

I will be using [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/) to render the Word documents as responsive HTML pages in the examples below. The API is a powerful [document viewer .NET API that supports rendering a large number of documents](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/supported-document-formats/). It allows building **HTML Viewer** with embedded and external resources, an **Image Viewer** by rendering as JPG and PNG, and **PDF Viewer** that is best for printing or sharing with others.

You can download the **DLLs** or **MSI** installer from the [downloads section](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/viewer) or install the API by adding its package to your .NET application via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/groupdocs.viewer).

```
PM> Install-Package GroupDocs.Viewer
```

## Convert Word Documents to View as Responsive HTML using C# {#word-to-html-responsive}

If you have MS Word DOC, DOCX documents, and want to render these documents into responsive HTML pages to look good on all the different screen sizes, here are the steps and C# code for you.

The following steps show how to convert the Word document (DOC/DOCX) to responsive HTML using .NET API.

*   Load the Word document (DOC/DOCX) using [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/groupdocs.viewer/viewer) class.
*   Set the [HtmlViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/groupdocs.viewer.options/htmlviewoptions) for either embedded or external resources for the html output.
*   Set the [RenderResponsive](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/groupdocs.viewer.options/htmlviewoptions/properties/renderresponsive) to true.
*   Call the [View](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/groupdocs.viewer/viewer/methods/view/index) method of Viewer class to generate the responsive webpages of the loaded Word document.

The following just a four-liner source code renders the Word document as responsive HTML with embedded resources using C#.
