**GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: enhanced caching options and added support for multiple instances with different root storage paths**

In the latest version (2.13.0) of the GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library released this month, we’ve implemented two new major features and over 40 minor improvements and bug fixes. The first major enhancement is the ability to cache PDF copies of original files. With this feature enabled, when setting the **UsePdfPrinting** and **DownloadPdfFileIfPossible** methods to **true**, the viewer doesn’t have to generate PDF copies of the original file upon each user request. Instead, the viewer checks whether the cached PDF copy of the document needs to be updated and, if not, uploads it to the client.

Another major improvement is the ability to use the viewer with an unlimited number of different independent root storage paths. For more details on the enhancements and bug fixes implemented in this release, as well as to download the latest version of the library, please go to [this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/8/.net-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_.net/entry7302.aspx).

**GroupDocs.Viewer for Java: improved overall rendering accuracy and optimized memory usage**

Among around 50 minor enhancements and bug fixes for GroupDocs.Viewer for Java, this month we managed to improve overall rendering accuracy, optimized dependencies and memory usage and significantly improved handling of PowerPoint files (PPT, PPTX). Please find a complete list of improvements, as well as download the latest version of GroupDocs.Viewer for Java on [this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/9/java-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_java/entry7101.aspx).

**GroupDocs.Total for Cloud API: improved handling of the Google File Picker, plus 20 other minor improvements**

In this month’s release, we’ve improved handling of file uploads requested via the Google File Picker, streamlined the process of integrating GroupDocs with Box.com’s cloud storage provider, added the ability of requesting user account deletion from the GroupDocs profile page and implemented a number of GUI style fixes. Please find more details about these and other updates along with new Cloud SDKs for .NET, Java, Python, Ruby, PHP and JavaScript on [this page](https://blog.groupdocs.com/get-up-and-running-quickly-with-groupdocs-total-for-cloud-api-using-the-latest-sdk-version-for-your-programming-language).

**GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: protect your documents with watermarks**

One of the most valuable features in GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET is the ability to display documents in a read-only mode. This way, businesses can protect their important documents from unauthorized copying or manipulation, while still sharing them with third parties. For an extra layer of security, GroupDocs.Viewer allows you to add custom watermarks over the displayed documents to protect them against screen-grabbing. Recently we’ve published a detailed guide to help developers quickly configure, customize and add watermarks to documents displayed with GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET. Please refer to [this page](https://blog.groupdocs.com/protect-your-documents-with-watermarks-in-groupdocs-viewer-for-dot-net) to read the guide.
