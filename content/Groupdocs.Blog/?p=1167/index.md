First of all, we'd like to wish you all a happy & prosperous New Year. For GroupDocs, 2012 was a significant year marked by milestones; we're proud and grateful to end a busy year with great achievements. With constant enhancements, we were able to prove that we're an integral part of the document management world. In 2012, we have introduced enhanced versions of our apps with added features from time to time; created a variety of plugins for multiple platforms; integrated many different storage options with GroupDocs; introduced flexible API SDKs to help you integrate our apps to your existing applications; and were able build a strong base of valuable customers, ranging from small to mid to enterprise level; amongst many others. Reflecting on the previous year, we're happy that we hit all the milestones that we set for 2012. We acknowledge your encouragement and support behind our success. We will continue to grow our operation, provide excellent customer support, and proceed with innovations to maintain and continue this kind of success in 2013 too.
