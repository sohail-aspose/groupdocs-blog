[![GroupDocs Viewer for .NET](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/11/groupdocs-viewer-net.png)](https://www.groupdocs.com/products/viewer/net)

We are excited to release another monthly release, version 17.9, of [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://www.groupdocs.com/products/viewer/net). This version allows you excluding fonts from HTML representation of the document and saving them as external resources. Also, we have extended the support of responsive HTML for **MS Visio documents**, **SVG images**, **MS Word documents**, **Open Office Text** and **Rich Text document format**. The latest version also includes some important bug fixes for the issues found in prior releases. We recommend you to upgrade to the latest version for an improved experience.

## Excluding Fonts when Rendering to HTML {#GroupDocs.Viewerfor.NET17.8.0ReleaseNotes-RenderingdocumentswithComments}Embedded fonts increase the size of the rendering result, therefore, in order to prevent adding fonts into HTML, we introduced **ExcludeFonts** property of **HtmlOptions** class. For more details on excluding fonts from HTML representation, please visit [this documentation article](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net "GroupDocs.Viewer features").

## GIF Images with Animation in Output HTML {#GroupDocs.Viewerfor.NET17.8.0ReleaseNotes-IgnoringemptyrowswhenrenderingCellsdocuments}In earlier versions, when rendering document into HTML, GIF images were converted into PNG format. Therefore, the images were displayed without animation in the resultant HTML. From version 17.9, we have added the support of saving the GIF images as it is when rendering the documents into HTML.
