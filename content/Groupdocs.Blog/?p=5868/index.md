[![GroupDocs.Viewer for Java](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/GD_VWR_JavaIcon_1141.png)](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library)Greetings! Recently we’ve released a new version – 2.7.0 – of the [GroupDocs.Viewer for Java library](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library) and in this post I’d like to share details about the most important enhancements we made in this latest version. Among a number of code optimizations and improvements, we’ve added the ability to rotate document pages in the image-based rendering mode, added support to relative license paths, and the ability to rotate text watermarks within the PDF print adjustments. But most importantly, we’ve updated the _InputDataHandler_ interface to make the process of handling documents from custom sources easier. Now you can simply pass files’ GUIDs, IDs, paths, etc. without worrying about any internal encoding. Overall, the implementation and usage of the updated _InputDataHandler_ interface became much simpler and more straightforward. We’ve prepared a detailed guide on how to configure the _InputDataHandler_ interface – please see it [on this page](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/java). Also, we’ve updated samples built based on the library, so that you can explore the new APIs yourself. In particular, there are individual samples for Spring, Dropwizard and Servlets currently available for your choice. You can either download them from our [website](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/9/java-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_java/category1004.aspx), or from the GitHub repositories:
