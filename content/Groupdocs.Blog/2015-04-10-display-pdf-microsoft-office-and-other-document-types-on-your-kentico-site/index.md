[![GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/04/GD_VWR_NETIcon_114.png)](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net)Kentico is quite a popular CMS focused largely on document management. At GroupDocs we create APIs that allow developers to enhance their applications and sites with convenient document collaboration tools. One of such tools is a multi-format, cross-platform compatible document viewer – GroupDocs.Viewer. It allows end users to view over 50 types of documents and images from any modern web-browser and without having to install any office software or plugins. To name just a few, the file formats that the viewer supports include: PDF and Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Visio diagrams, Outlook messages, CAD drawings, multipage TIFF files and [a lot more](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-viewer-library/features#supportForAllCommonDocumentFormats). Another important feature – is the ability to display documents in a “read-only” mode. GroupDocs.Viewer allows you to prevent unauthorized copying of your documents while still sharing them with others. You can disable print, download and text copy options for specified documents and add watermarks to protect documents from screen-grabbing. Currently GroupDocs.Viewer exists in different forms: it is available as a .NET class library (DLL), Java library (JAR) and as a Cloud API (SaaS). Earlier we already released a plugin that allows Kentico developers and site owners to seamlessly integrate the Cloud (SaaS) version of GroupDocs.Viewer into their sites. The plugin can be found on the Kentico marketplace. The cloud version of the viewer simply creates an iframe on a web-page and redirects all input documents to the cloud API. Hence, documents have to be hosted on GroupDocs servers. Although we use secure Amazon EC2 infrastructure, there are cases when you need to keep your documents in-house and avoid any external requests to them or deploy the viewer on your intranet. If that is the case, you may be interested in a new plugin that we’ve just released for the .NET version of the viewer. This version can be deployed on-premises and doesn’t require any external API calls. The plugin has been tested by Kentico and is now officially published on the Kentico marketplace. This new version of the plugin is free for customers who own a GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET license. If you don’t have one, you can test the viewer on your site in an evaluation mode, or request a free fully-functional 30-day trial simply by [contacting](http://groupdocs.com/corporate/contact-us) our support team.

Also please visit our [documentation portal](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net) for a detailed guide on how to deploy the viewer on your Kentico site.
