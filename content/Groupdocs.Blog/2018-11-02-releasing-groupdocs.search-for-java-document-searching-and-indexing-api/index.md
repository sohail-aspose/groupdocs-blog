# Example Business Cases

You have a folder with a lot of books and you want to search for a specific text in them. It would be difficult to do it manually but GroupDocs.Search can perform the search for you with accuracy in few steps. Just create the index for the folder, use the search query and you will get the results. In case more books are added to the folder, you would just need to update the index. Furthermore, you can index multiple folders as well as search the query in multiple indexes.
