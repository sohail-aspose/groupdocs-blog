Great news to contract management world! After the successful integration of [GroupDocs Annotation](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/plugins/annotation) and [GroupDocs Viewer](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/plugins/viewer) apps with multiple platforms, GroupDocs have now introduced its [efficient contract management software plugin](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/plugins/assembly) to multiple platforms. Now, no matter what CMS you use, you can integrate our contract management software plugin to your websites. \[caption id="attachment\_1721" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="GroupDocs introduced its contract management software plugin for various CMSs"\]![GroupDocs introduced its contract management software plugin for various CMSs](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/03/GroupDocs-introduced-its-contract-management-software-app-for-various-CMSs.png "GroupDocs introduced its contract management software plugin for various CMSs")\[/caption\] Once the [plugin](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/plugins) is installed, you can embed questionnaires and then collect data to automatically create new documents online.

It is usually used for contract management, for example, in legal letters, legal agreements, quotes, etc. The most common scenario would be for assembling documents where most of the information remains the same, but some details like name, address, date, start date or income, etc. differs from one person to another. [GroupDocs Assembly](http://groupdocs.com/apps/assembly) plugin makes document assembly too simple:

1.  First, prepare a document template by adding merge field.
2.  Then create a questionnaire in [apps.groupdocs.com](https://apps.groupdocs.com/sign-up). This questionnaire lets recipients enter data.
3.  Then embed the questionnaire to your preferred CMS using the questionnaire form ID.
4.  Finally, share it with your customers to collect responses.
