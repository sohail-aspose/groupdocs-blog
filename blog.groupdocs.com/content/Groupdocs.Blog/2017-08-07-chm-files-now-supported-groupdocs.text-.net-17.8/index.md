[![GroupDocs.Text for .NET](http://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/04/groupdocs.text-for-dotnet.png)](https://products.groupdocs.com/)Team GroupDocs is pleased to notify its users about the regular monthly release of version 17.8.0 of the [.NET Text extraction API](https://docs.groupdocs.com/). The latest release introduces support for .chm files and allows its users to extract text from **CHM** files. This feature allows extracting either a single line or all text characters from a file of .chm format. We highly recommend our users to [download](http://downloads.groupdocs.com/text/net) or update the API to the latest version and get advantage of the ability to extract text from the CHM files.

# The Text Extraction API - New Features
