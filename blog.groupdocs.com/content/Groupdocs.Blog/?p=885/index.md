We are excited to announce that we continued to integrate with 3rd party platforms in the month of September. For the coming month, we’re working on application enhancements like a new app interface design for [document annotation](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation) and enhanced dashboard functionality for [document assembly](http://groupdocs.com/apps/assembly). We’ll also continue to extend our app integration to more 3rd party platforms.
