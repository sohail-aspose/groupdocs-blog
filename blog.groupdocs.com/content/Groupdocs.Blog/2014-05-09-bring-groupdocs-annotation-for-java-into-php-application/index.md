And special greetings to the PHP community, since this time we are going to bring GroupDocs.Annotation for Java to your world. The [GroupDocs.Annotation for Java library](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-annotation-library) is a rich online collaboration tool for reviewing and annotating documents on the web. With high fidelity document rendering, it provides end-users with a comprehensive set of commenting and markup tools. Designed to work in the web and implemented in the HTML5-compliant borders, GroupDocs.Annotation for Java library supports over **50 file formats**, including PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents, as well as TIFF, PNG, JPG and other image formats. Earlier it was kind of unclear for developers working on platforms other than .NET and Java, in particular for those who work in a PHP environment, how to integrate the GroupDocs.Annotation for Java library into their application. We all know that using iframes is not the best solution out there. So, in this article we'd like to share a detailed guide of how to integrate the GroupDocs.Annotation for Java into a PHP application without having to use iframes.
