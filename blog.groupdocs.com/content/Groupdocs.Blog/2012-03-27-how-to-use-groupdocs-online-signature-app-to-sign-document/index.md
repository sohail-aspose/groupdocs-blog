In one of our previous articles we discussed [how a typical online signature service works](https://blog.groupdocs.com/what-you-expect-from-online-signature-service) and took a brief look at GroupDocs' [online signature app](http://groupdocs.com/apps/signature). Today we'll see how this application helps you to sign a document online step by step. This article doesn't cover all the features of the app, just the basics you need to know to sign a document online. **Please Note:** to start using GroupDocs' online signature service, you need to [register with us](http://groupdocs.com/purchase/cloud-app-pricing) first. But don't worry: we provide a free 14 days trial so that you can test the apps' features before buying it.
