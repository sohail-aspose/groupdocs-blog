We're excited to announce that Windows Azure has been integrated with **GroupDocs**. This allows you to setup [a new storage provision](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/storage/windows-azure) for storing your GroupDocs files. With this enhancement, you can configure Microsoft Azure as your default storage provider from within GroupDocs and store your files in the Azure container. GroupDocs provides you with [flexible storage options](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/storage), which is an essential element when opting for an efficient [document management solution](http://groupdocs.com/). This integration puts you in charge of selecting your preferred storage provider, making your **document management** process user friendly and flexible. \[caption id="attachment\_1019" align="alignnone" width="600" caption="Announcing Windows Azure integration with GroupDocs' document management solutions"\]![Announcing Windows Azure integration with GroupDocs' document management solutions](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/09/Announcing-Windows-Azure-integration-with-GroupDocs-document-management-soolutions1.png)\[/caption\] The GroupDocs-Azure integration brings you various benefits, which are listed below:  

*   Upload huge volumes of files to your Azure container, which can then be used with different GroupDocs apps.
*   Authority to select your storage provider, which is a unique feature that adds flexibility to GroupDocs’ document management solutions.
*   Benefit from Azure's advanced data security features.
*   Easily integrate your document management with third-party applications.

First, create a Windows Azure account to get primary access key and account name.  Once you have collected the required details, log in to GroupDocs to configure these details. The steps are as follows:

1.  Go to the **Storage Provider** area on your profile page.
2.  Select **Azure** from the **Provider** list.
3.  Enter your Azure account name in the **Account Name** field.
4.  Enter the primary access key from your Azure account in the **Account Key** field.
5.  Enter a preferred container name for your Azure container in the **Container** field.
6.  Click **Apply**.

One important point here is that you don’t need to create an Azure container on your own. Simply choose a name for the container, and GroupDocs will do the rest. Creating a container in Azure is otherwise a complex task. Please refer to our **[Integration of GroupDocs with Windows Azure](https://docs.groupdocs.cloud/total/configure-windows-azure-storage/)** documentation to get an in-depth description of how to integrate with Azure.
