It's been quite long since we released the last version of [GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/watermark/net) API. The reason behind this gap was to introduce a more simplified and optimized watermark manipulation API for the .NET platform. Today, I am excited to announce that the API v2 of _GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET_ has been released as **v19.10** and it is available for [download](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/watermark/net).

## What's new in the latest release?

The major updates have been done at the architecture level of the API to simplify its usage. Furthermore, we have performed major product optimization in the codebase and introduced unified classes to deal with watermarking operations for all the supported document formats. Some key reasons for these updates are listed below:

*   _[Watermarker](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/net/watermark/groupdocs.watermark/watermarker)_ class is introduced as a single entry point to manage watermarks in the document (instead of _Document_ class from previous versions).
*   Adding watermarks has been unified for all supported document formats.
*   The product architecture has been redesigned from scratch in order to simplify the usage of different options to manage the watermarks.
*   Document information and preview generation procedures have been simplified.

## How to migrate?

The legacy API has been moved into _[Legacy](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/watermark/net)_ namespace so you'll have to make a project-wide replacement of namespaces from **GroupDocs.Watermark** to **GroupDocs.Watermark.Legacy** to resolve build issues after upgrading to v19.10. Furthermore, below is a code comparison of how to use the basic features of the API using the old and the latest version.
