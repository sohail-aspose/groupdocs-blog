[![GroupDocs.Viewer](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2015/07/GD_VWR_Icon_114-WEB.png)](http://groupdocs.com/html5-document-viewer)We are pleased to announce the release of a new plugin that allows WordPress developers and website owners to easily integrate GroupDocs.Viewer for Java into their websites. This is a third plugin in a series of [GroupDocs.Viewer](http://groupdocs.com/html5-document-viewer) plugins for WordPress. Depending on your deployment preferences, you can now choose between 3 versions of the viewer: a cloud-based integration, a downloadable .NET library, or downloadable Java library for on-premises deployment. All three versions have been approved by the WordPress admins and are officially published on the WordPress marketplace. Regardless of the deployment option you choose, GroupDocs.Viewer provides you with the following benefits: - **Support for more than 50 common document types.** To name just a few, GroupDocs.Viewer allows you to display PDF and Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Outlook messages, Visio diagrams, CAD drawings and many more, all on any page within your WordPress website. - **Cross-platform compatibility.** GroupDocs.Viewer doesnâ€™t require any software or plugin installation on end-users machines and works across devices that have any standard web-browser, including Internet Explorer 8+, Safari 5+, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera. - **Embeddable widget for flawless online document reading.** GroupDocs.Viewer comes with an out-of-the-box UI that can be easily customized with your own CSS and embedded to a web page as a document viewing widget. The UI allows end users to seamlessly navigate large multi-page documents directly on your website. In particular, users can turn pages like slides, preview pages with thumbnails, jump straight to a specified page, search for text within embedded documents using keywords, zoom in/out of a document or fit width/height, etc. - **Secure document sharing.** Thanks to the in-built DRM (Digital Rights Management) feature, you can prevent documents embedded to your WordPress website from being copied by end users. The feature allows you to disable the print, download and text copy options for all or specific documents, so that they are displayed in a read-only mode. More than that, GroupDocs.Viewer allows you to display watermarks over the embedded documents to protect them against screen-grabbing. For more details on GroupDocs.Viewer, supported document types and deployment options, please see [this page](http://groupdocs.com/html5-document-viewer). The WordPress plugins which allow you to seamlessly integrate the viewer into your website can be downloaded from the official WordPress marketplace: [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://wordpress.org/plugins/groupdocs-viewer-for-dot-net-html5-document-viewer/) [GroupDocs.Viewer for Java](https://wordpress.org/plugins/groupdocs-java-document-viewer/) [GroupDocs.Viewer for Cloud](https://wordpress.org/plugins/groupdocs-viewer/)
