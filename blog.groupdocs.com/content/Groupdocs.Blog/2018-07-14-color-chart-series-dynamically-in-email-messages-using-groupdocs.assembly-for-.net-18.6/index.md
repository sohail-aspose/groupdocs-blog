![](http://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2017/04/groupdocs-assembly-net.png)[GroupDocs](https://www.groupdocs.com/) team is proudly announcing two new features and three enhancements in the monthly release of [GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/assembly/net) **18.6**. Using the latest version, you can now use C# 6.0 null-conditional operators **?. **and **?\[\]**. Change the color of chart series and individual point series dynamically for Email Messages with HTML and RTF bodies. Furthermore, to enhance the API,  colors are preserved for a pie chart in the Word Processing document, fonts are preserved for a chart title, and static colors are preserved for chart series in the Email document. We recommend you to [install](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GroupDocs.Assembly/) and use the latest version of the API.
