[![GroupDocs.Viewer for Java icon](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/GD_VWR_JavaIcon_1141.png "GroupDocs.Viewer for Java")](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library) The [GroupDocs.Viewer for Java library](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library) is a high-fidelity document viewer, built within HTML5 standards. It allows end-users to view over 45 types of documents on the web without the need to install any third-party software. Here at GroupDocs we always look for new ways to enhance our products with advanced security options. The GroupDocs.Viewer for Java library can be deployed on-premises and allows you to host documents on your private storage. This ensures you have complete control over documents security on the server side. But how to protect your content from unauthorized use when documents are exposed to users? GroupDocs.Viewer for Java allows you to easily restrict or disable the document printing, downloading and copying options. And in the recently released [version 2.2](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/9/java-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_java/default.aspx), we've added yet another security layer which allows you to prevent browser cashing of viewed documents (that is, temporary storage of rendered pages). This option can be enabled with the help of a new parameter called _useBrowserCache_. In the following article I'd like to provide you with several useful tips about advanced caching strategies you can implement using this parameter, or without it, in case you use an earlier version of the library.
