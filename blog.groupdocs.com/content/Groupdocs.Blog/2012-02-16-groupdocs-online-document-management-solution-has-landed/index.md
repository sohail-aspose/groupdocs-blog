## Our Vision

From the outset we wanted to bridge the gap between desktop computing and cloud computing. In the past there was a gulf between Microsoft and non-Microsoft platforms. Users on one platform found it difficult to collaborate and communicate with users on the other. New technologies have made communication easier, but not seamless. Locking yourself into one platform limits you: you might miss out on opportunities. So we chose to use Web 2.0 technology to bridge the platform gap and make document sharing and collaborating easier.

We are determined to provide you with the best, most affordable and easy-to-use online document management and collaboration solutions.

## What We Do?

The GroupDocs team consists of highly skilled developers working to create efficient platform and software independent online document management apps. GroupDocs also offers a powerful set of APIs to assist developers to get the most out of the GroupDocs Apps Suite. With GroupDocs, you can upload and store documents and perform various document manipulation operations. You can download updated documents and store them in the online repository or share them with your contacts.

## How Can We Help?

Everyone works with documents. GroupDocs makes it easier to collaborate, share and work with documents online anytime, anywhere.
