[![GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET Library](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/10/GD_CNV_NETIcon_114.png)](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-conversion-library)GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET is one of emerging products in the GroupDocs product family. GroupDocs.Conversion allows users to convert documents to and from over 50 different formats, including Word (DOC, DOCX) to PDF, PDF to image (TIFF, JPG), HTML to PDF, Word to HTML and many more. Unlike most of the software on the market, GroupDocs.Conversion is a .NET middleware designed specifically for easy integration into other applications. Thanks to its flexible API, GroupDocs.Conversion can be used in any .NET application: desktop-based (like console apps, WinForms, WPF and Windows services) and web-based (ASP.NET, including WebForms and MVC). In one of our [earlier articles](https://blog.groupdocs.com/groupdocs-conversion-for-dot-net-library-convert-in-c-sharp-vb-net-word-doc-to-pdf-to-image-and-more) we discovered some of the key features and benefits of this library. In particular, GroupDocs.Conversion allows fast on-the-fly conversion and provides a number of interesting features designed especially for ASP.NET. For example, progress callbacks let the calling webpage know when a conversion has been completed. In this introduction article I'd like to show you basic and advanced usage of the GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET library in several types of applications.
