![GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/04/GD_VWR_NETIcon_114.png)Weâ€™re pleased to inform GetSimple developers that the .NET version of GroupDocs.Viewer can be seamlessly integrated into their websites thanks to a plugin we released a few weeks ago. With this plugin installed, you can embed and display over 50 types of documents and images on any page within your website. To name a few, supported formats include: PDF and Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Visio diagrams and CAD drawings. Unlike the cloud-based version, GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET is a downloadable library that can be installed on your own server. It allows you to store documents locally and host content behind your firewalls. The library is designed to be easy to integrate into any ASP.NET app or website and comes with an embeddable web UI. The plugin is absolutely free and can be downloaded from the official [GetSimple marketplace](http://get-simple.info/extend/plugin/groupdocsviewer-for-net-html5-document-viewer/857/). Please note that the plugin requires the GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library to be installed first. You can download a free evaluation copy of the library from [this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/8/.net-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_.net/default.aspx). For more detail on the .NET/ASP.NET version of the viewer, please see [this page](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-viewer-library).
