![Java PDF Annotation](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/03/GD_ANT_JavaIcon_1141.png "GroupDocs.Annotation_for_Java")We are pleased to inform developers, especially those of you who prefer the Linux platform, about the release of theÂ [GroupDocs.Annotation for Java library](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-annotation-library). It is an HTML5 standard compliant library that allows you to display PDF, Microsoft Office and image files and comes with a comprehensive set of document commenting and markup tools. The viewer can work two ways: by rasterizing documents or by converting them to a combination of SVG, HTML and CSS. Both methods deliver clear, high-fidelity rendering. Key benefits include:

*   Seamlessly enable end users to view, annotate, share and print more than 45 document formats, including PDF, Microsoft Office (DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX, etc.) and OpenDocument files (ODT, ODS, etc.), plain text documents, CAD and raster images within your Java apps.
*   Documents can be rendered as real text files (HTML5 based technology of HTML, CSS and SVG combination), meaning users can select, mark up, strikeout and comment on text within a document.
*   GroupDocs.Annotation for Java is a 100% native solution - you don't need any 3rd party software.
*   Simplicity of installation - the library can be deployed with a packaged JAR file or hosted within your own servlet container.
*   Using only a few JavaScript lines or an iframe, you can integrate the UI, which can be easily customized to fit the look and style of your own app.
*   GroupDocs.Annotation for Java is set up to work cross-domain using JSONP and CORS, so it's designed to be run external to projects. Thanks to this, PHP and RoR Linux-based applications can use it from within the same server.
*   The library allows end users to view and annotate documents from any web-enabled device, including tablets and mobiles, and using any HTML5 compliant web-browser.
