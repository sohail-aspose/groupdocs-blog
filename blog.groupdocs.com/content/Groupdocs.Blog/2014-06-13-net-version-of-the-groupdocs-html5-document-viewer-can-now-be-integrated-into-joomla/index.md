![GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET Logo](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/03/GD_VWR_NETIcon_114.png)Greetings! We have good news for Joomla! developers. Recently we've released an extension which helps you to easily integrate the .NET version of the GroupDocs HTML5 document viewer into Joomla! websites. And now we are glad to announce that the extension is published and available for download from the [official Joomla! marketplace](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/social-web/social-display/documents-cloud-based/26890). Unlike the [cloud-based extension](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/social-web/social-display/documents-cloud-based/22977) released earlier, this one integrates the downloadable .NET version of the GroupDocs.Viewer. It allows you to store and host documents on your (or your clients') servers. There is no need to transfer documents to GroupDocs servers as in the cloud-based version. So, you have complete control over documents security. The new extension can be used by registered users of the GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library for free. If you don't have a license for the library and would like to test the extension on your Joomla! website, please feel free to [contact our sales](http://groupdocs.com/corporate/contact-us) for a 30-day trial. For more details on the extension, please visit [Joomla! marketplace](http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/social-web/social-display/documents-cloud-based/26890).
