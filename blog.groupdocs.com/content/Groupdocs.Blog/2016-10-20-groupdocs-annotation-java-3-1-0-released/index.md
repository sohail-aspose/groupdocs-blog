This API has more advanced capabilities to annotate documents with area annotation, text highlight, text underline, text strikeout, watermarking, reply based comments and many more. The Next Generation GroupDocs.Annotation for Java 3.1.0 is a UI less API to facilitate the developers to create any kind of application including Desktop, Web and cloud applications.

# Why newer version

Older 2.x versions of GroupDocs.Annotation for java had UI and very complex and dependent API structure, becuase of which it required more coding efforts even for a simple application. Also developers have to code in a specific way for each development environment. Whereas, Next Generation GroupDocs.Annotation for Java API don't have any UI, instead, all of its features are on back-end, implemented using simplified Object Oriented approach. In order to get more control over Annotations Management Processes (Adding, Removing, and Editing) in your PDF document, a new release of GroupDocs.Annotation is on board by GroupDocs team. **[Read more](http://www.groupdocs.com/docs/display/annotationjava/Features+Overview)**
