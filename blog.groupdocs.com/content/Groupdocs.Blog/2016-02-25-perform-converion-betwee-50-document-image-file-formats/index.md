Therefore, the API now supports generic document conversion for any application In Next Generation GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET, there is no more dependency for Web.UI based classes. Instead, only a single "GroupDocs.Conversion"  Namespace is required to convert any document with advanced options for any applications. Whereas, in GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET 1.10.0, document conversion required separate namespace for each format and was dependent on web components classes. **Supported Document Format Conversions**
