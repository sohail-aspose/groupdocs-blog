Great news for all Drupal CMS users! We have released a [PDF viewer module for Drupal](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/plugins/viewer/drupal). The module allows you to seamlessly embed PDF documents, as well as PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets, word processing documents and images into web-pages on your Drupal website. ![GroupDocs document viewer module for Drupal](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/11/Announcing-GroupDocs-online-document-viewer-module-for-Drupal.png) The PDF document viewer module for Drupal utilizes our GroupDocs Viewer's functionality and provides you with the following benefits:

1.  Your website visitors don't need any browser plug-ins or Flash to view documents hosted with our document viewer. You just put a document on your Drupal web-page and visitors can view it right away.
2.  High-fidelity rendering. Embedded documents look just like the originals. Layout, formatting and fonts are retained and text looks sharp.
3.  While viewing documents, users can quickly turn pages with the Go Forward/Backward buttons, just like in a slideshow. Also users can jump straight to a certain page and preview pages with thumbnails.
4.  GroupDocs Viewer doesn't convert documents to images, but renders them as real text documents. Your visitors will be able to copy text right from the embedded documents or search for a particular text within the document.
5.  Users can zoom in or out of documents, as well as print and download the original file right from your Drupal web-pages.
6.  Options like text copying, document printing and downloading can be disabled so that users can't copy the document.
7.  Finally, thanks to the newly released module, you can easily integrate the GroupDocs Viewer's functionality into your Drupal website and start hosting PDF and Office documents on your web-pages in minutes.
