[Moodle](https://moodle.org/) is a powerful learning management system that provides educators and learners with a robust set of tools for building and administrating collaborative learning environments. When integrated into Moodle, [GroupDocs.Viewer](http://groupdocs.com/html5-document-viewer) enables both educators and learners to view and securely share documents, drawings and images in more than **50 different file formats** â€“ all from within Moodle environment and without having to install original software used to create the files.

GroupDocs.Viewer is a multi-format HTML5-based document viewer that comes with a web-based user interface. The UI can be embedded into any web-page as a widget for viewing documents online. You can then either pre-load documents yourself, or let end users to upload documents from a shared library, or a personal storage to view them directly from within Moodle. To name just a few, supported file types include: PDF and Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Outlook messages, Project files, Visio diagrams, CAD drawings and raster images (TIFF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP) and many more.

All supported file types can be viewed from any device with a standard web-browser and without having to leave Moodle. Supported web browsers include Internet Explorer 8+, Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari 5+ and their mobile versions.

A comprehensive set of controls for flawless online document reading and review makes GroupDocs.Viewer an ideal solution for your e-learning environment. When viewing documents online, users can quickly find needed content thanks to the powerful text search and thumbnail page preview options.

GroupDocs.Viewer also allows you to share documents in a **read-only mode**. Its in-built browser-based Digital Rights Management (DRM) feature allows you to disable the print, download and text selection/copy options for all or specific documents that you share in Moodle. And for an extra layer of security, you can add watermarks to protect the documents against screen-grabbing.

If you are interested in integrating GroupDocs.Viewer into your Moodle environment, there are three deployment options available for your choice. The first is a **SaaS deployment** based on the [cloud version](https://products.groupdocs.cloud/viewer/family) of the viewer. It offers an easy deployment process but requires your documents to be stored and hosted on GroupDocs servers. To guarantee the security and privacy of your content, we use Amazon EC2 infrastructure and SSL encrypted connections. We also developed a plugin for the cloud version, which makes the integration process a breeze.

For customers who prefer to keep documents in-house, we offer downloadable [.NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/net) and [Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/java) libraries for **on-premises deployment**. These versions are also supported by plugins for seamless integration into Moodle. Today we are happy to inform that all plugins were approved by Moodle admins and can be downloaded from the official Moodle marketplace:

GroupDocs.Viewer .NET plugin for Moodle  
GroupDocs.Viewer Java plugin for Moodle  
GroupDocs.Viewer Cloud plugin for Moodle
