The advancement in technology has increased the variety of tools available in the market which can enhance the convenience and productivity of a business. If you are a regular user of basic office data handling tools, like PDF, you must be needing a document comparison API which can reduce your labour hours while increasing the productivity of operations.

## GroupDocs.Comparison - A Document Comparison API

GroupDocs.Comparison allows you to achieve your purpose in a short amount of time. This API lets you compare two documents of supported formats and compare them to find out the similarities and differences easily. For example, if your regular job requires you to compare lists of thousands of orders a day to find similar serial numbers. This API will be able to do this job in the matter of seconds.

There are numerous organizations worldwide which rely on PDF formatted programs to handle their data. Mostly, data management departments of a company hire a huge workforce to manage the duplication or differentiation of serial numbers of orders. GroupDocs.Comparison helps these companies in minimizing their expenses in the labour force while increasing productivity.

## Custom Change Styles – One of the Most Useful Feature

This API offers multiple features which can help you in the execution of multiple tasks. Some of these features include Detail Level, Generate Summary Page, Show Deleted Content, Style Change Detection, Item Styles, Words Separator and Sensitivity of Comparison.

The most useful feature is “Customize Change Styles”. This feature allows the user to set his own parameters while comparing the data. This option offers a default setting of the parameters which are utilized on a general basis and offers an efficient comparison.

You can follow these steps to compare two documents with custom change style settings:

*   Instantiate Comparer object with source document path or stream;
*   Call Add method and specify the target document path or stream;
*   Instantiate CompareOptions object with desired parameters;
*   Call Compare method and pass CompareOptions object to method;
