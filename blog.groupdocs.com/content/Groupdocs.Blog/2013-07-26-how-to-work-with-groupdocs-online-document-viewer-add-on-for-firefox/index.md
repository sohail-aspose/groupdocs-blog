It allows you to view literally all types of word processing documents (DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, ODT), PowerPoint presentations (PPT, PPTX), SpreadSheets (XLS, XLSX), portable files (PDF), and image files (JPG, BMP, GIF, TIFF).GroupDocs Viewer is a mobile-ready application, meaning that you can view documents online from any web-enabled device. With this online document viewer add-on for FireFox, it is now even easier to access, view and manage documents in your GroupDocs account.
