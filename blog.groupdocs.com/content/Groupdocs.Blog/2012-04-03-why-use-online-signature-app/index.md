In the digital world e-signature is actively replacing the traditional way of signing documents. Today, you can find a large number of online signature services on the market. All of them intend to help people sign documents online, using only a web browser. If you're wondering why such applications are so popular, and what benefits they provide, this article is for you.

## The Benefits of an Online Signature Application

### Save TimeThe normal process of signing a contract includes updating a document with client information, printing or scanning it, filing, signing, mailing, and then waiting for the signed document to be returned. Sometimes these steps are repeated, for example, if there are errors in the document, signatures have been missed out, delivery issues or other problems. Even sending the document through physical mail takes time: first you have to enclose the document in an envelope, bring it to a post office and then wait till the recipient gets your mail, signs the document and sends it back. It can take days or even weeks. With an [online signature](http://groupdocs.com/apps/signature) app, such as GroupDocs Signature, you can get a document signed online in minutes even if your customers or partners are located in different countries. GroupDocs' online signature app allows you to upload a document, add all necessary information, sign it and invite signers to sign the document via email. Both you and the signers are informed by email once the document is signed.

### Save MoneyWe've just discussed how utilizing an online signature app saves your time. But don't forget: time is money. With an online signature app you can get contracts closed in minutes! Moreover, using an online signature service is much more cost effective than signing documents in a traditional way - you don't have to pay for paper, ink, printer or scanner maintenance, mail delivery, etc.

### Your Documents are Safe and SecureWith an online signature service you don't need to worry about security issues because your documents are encrypted and stored securely online, so nobody can fake your identity and forge your signature. Your documents are fully protected from unauthorized access.

### Your Online Signature is Absolutely Legal[The Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce (E-SIGN) Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Signatures_in_Global_and_National_Commerce_Act) which was signed in the USA in 2000 gave electronic signatures the same legal standing as handwritten ones. Documents signed with a [reputable online signature service](http://groupdocs.com/apps/signature) are absolutely legally binding in most developed countries. So you can be sure that your electronic signature is as legal as its hard copy and acceptable on legal documents.
