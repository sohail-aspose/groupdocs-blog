**GroupDocs.Viewer for Java V3.0.0**

It’s time to lay a hand on Next Generation GroupDocs.Viewer for Java 3.0.0. GroupDocs releases this product with the great power of rendering a variety of document formats to HTML and image representations.  
  
The legacy 2.x versions of GroupDocs.Viewer for Java had a complex API structure thereby requiring more coding efforts for a simple implementation. Document generation is no longer coupled with GUI and web, thus enabling you to use GroupDocs.Viewer for Java 3.0.0 in a larger number of scenarios.
