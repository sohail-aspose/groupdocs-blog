Greetings everyone! [![GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET Library logo](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/02/GD_ANT_NETIcon_114.png)](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-annotation-library) Not all of you might know that the latest version of the [GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-annotation-library "Flexible .NET Library for HTML5 Document Annotation") can read and save annotated documents not only from local storage or web links, but also from network storage. In other words, you can now locate documents on any network machine. This feature can be useful for businesses who have several machines networked to one main storage, or for customers who use one machine as a server and another one as a file storage. In this article I'd like to show you how to use network storage with the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library and how to configure your servers.
