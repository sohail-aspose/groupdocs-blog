We're going to introduce an improvement in the naming scheme of our [GroupDocs Nuget packages](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/groupdocs). Earlier, the package IDs were consisted of the product name in lower case letters and the hyphens "-" to join the words. So, an old package ID would look like "groupdocs-viewer-dotnet". However, in the new naming scheme, the format will consist the product family name in title case. Hence, the new package identifier will look like "GroupDocs.Viewer". These changes have been introduced since September 2017 and any packages published from here on will follow the new naming scheme. We hope that this announcement will help to avoid any confusion. If you still find any questions or concerns, please feel free to get in touch with us via our [support forums](https://forum.groupdocs.com). Weâ€™ll be happy to hear from you and provide any assistance.
