Outlook Metadata Cleaner is an Outlook add-in powered by [GroupDocs.Metadata for .NET](http://www.groupdocs.com/products/metadata/net ".NET Metadata API") that removes/cleans metadata properties in the files selected to be attached with email. It is an attach file button that appears in New Message window in Outlook. When some file is selected to be attached with email, the add-in first cleans all the metadata information saved with that file and then attaches metadata free file with email message.

**Why Outlook Metadata Cleaner is needed?** Email is one of the primary and mostly used sources of communication. Business documents and files sent through emails may contain some secret and private information in form of metadata. Companies and individuals owning these files might be very much concerned about the prevention of leakage of any of their organizational or private information. Exposure of sensitive metadata to any unauthorized person could have harm the reputation and privacy of any organization or individual. To cope with this, GroupDocs introduces Outlook Metadata Cleaner add-in to be integrated with MS Outlook.
