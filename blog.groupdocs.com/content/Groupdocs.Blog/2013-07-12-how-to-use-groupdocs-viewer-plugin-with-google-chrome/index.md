We have published a GroupDocs' online document viewer plugin for Chrome. This add-on provides GroupDocs users with a slick interface for viewing documents right in the Chrome browser. [GroupDocs' Online Document Viewer](http://groupdocs.com/apps/viewer) gives you the ability to view documents and images right in your web browser, without having to install bulky office software. Whether you need to view a text document, an image or a PowerPoint presentation, GroupDocs' online document viewer opens it for you. The list of supported file formats is long and constantly increasing:

*   Word processing documents (DOC, DOCX, TXT, RTF, ODT)
*   PowerPoint presentations (PPT, PPTX)
*   Image files (JPG, BMP, GIF, TIFF)
*   Portable files (PDF)
*   Spreadsheets (XLS, XLSX)

Thanks to its smart rendering engine, GroupDocs Viewer retains the formatting of your documents in high fidelity. Whether you open a file in its native program or using this online document viewer, it looks exactly the same. With the plug-in, you no longer have to log in to the GroupDocs website to view a document. After you install the add-on, a small widget appears in the bottom-left corner of your Chrome browser and allows you to access, view and manage your documents with just a couple of clicks. And if you need to view a document on the go, you can use GroupDocs Viewer on any web-enabled mobile device. In this article, we will see how to install and use the GroupDocs' online document viewer plugin. It's really simple.
