[![Document Viewer API](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/11/groupdocs-viewer-net.png)](https://www.groupdocs.com/products/viewer/net)

We have released version 18.5 of [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/net) with a couple of new features as well as 12 improvements and bug fixes. The latest version includes the feature of setting output page size when rendering email messages as image and PDF. Furthermore, you can now change the field labels in the header of the email messages. The feature of rendering password protected documents has also been extended for **ODT** and **OTT** formats. Below is the list of new features, improvements, and fixes added in GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET 18.5.

## Setting Output Page Size when Rendering Email MessagesSince the version 18.5, it is possible to set output page size when rendering Email messages as PDF and images. To enable this feature, set the _PageSize_property of the _EmailOptions_ class as shown in the following code snippet.```
string guid = "long-email.msg";
   
//Instantiate Viewer Hanlder 
ViewerImageHandler imageHandler = new ViewerImageHandler();
   
//Set page size  
ImageOptions imageOptions = new ImageOptions();
imageOptions.EmailOptions.PageSize = PageSize.A4;
  
//Render document with custom page size
List pages = imageHandler.GetPages(guid, imageOptions);
  
//Use Stream property of the PageImage class, to get output image.
foreach (PageImage page in pages)
{
    Console.WriteLine(page.Stream.Length);
}
```For more details on this feature, please visit [this](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net) documentation article.

## Changing Field Labels in Email's HeaderWhen rendering email messages, by default the API uses the English language to render field labels such as From, To, Subject etc.. Starting from 18.5, GroupDocs.Viewer provides a new property _FieldLabels _in _EmailOptions _class to change the field labels. Following code snippet shows how to use custom field labels.```
string guid = "email.msg";

//Instantiate Viewer Hanlder 
ViewerHtmlHandler htmlHandler = new ViewerHtmlHandler();

//Set field labels 
HtmlOptions htmlOptions = new HtmlOptions();
htmlOptions.EmailOptions.FieldLabels[EmailField.From] = "Sender";
htmlOptions.EmailOptions.FieldLabels[EmailField.To] = "Receiver";
htmlOptions.EmailOptions.FieldLabels[EmailField.Sent] = "Date";
htmlOptions.EmailOptions.FieldLabels[EmailField.Subject] = "Topic";
//Render document with custom field labels
List pages = htmlHandler.GetPages(guid, htmlOptions);
```For more details on this feature, please visit [this](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net) documentation article.
