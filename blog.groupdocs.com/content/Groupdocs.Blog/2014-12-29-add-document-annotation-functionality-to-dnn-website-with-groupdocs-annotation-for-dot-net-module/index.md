![GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET Library logo](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/02/GD_ANT_NETIcon_114.png)We’re pleased to announce the release of the DNN module that allows developers to easily integrate the GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library into DNN websites. This is a “full-integration” module that doesn’t require the library to be installed separately. The module has been approved by the DNN admins and is now available for download from the [official DNN store](http://store.dnnsoftware.com/home/product-details/groupdocs-annotation-for-net-html5-document-annotation). A few words about the library itself. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET is an [HTML5-based document annotator](http://groupdocs.com/html5-document-annotation) designed specifically for integration into third-party apps and websites. It is a client-server middleware that converts documents to a web-compatible form (HTML, CSS, images, JS) and then renders these on client machines through a web widget along with a comprehensive set of annotation tools. The library allows end users to view, securely share and annotate over 50 document and image types using any HTML5-compatible web-browser. Supported file formats include, but not limited to: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, OpenDocument, CAD and raster images. Unlike the [cloud-based module](http://store.dnnsoftware.com/home/product-details/groupdocs-documents-image-and-pdf-annotation-plugin) which we released earlier, this one integrates the downloadable .NET library, meaning you can deploy it on-premises. This allows you to host and store your documents locally. Users who already own a GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET license can use the module for free. In case you don’t have a license yet, please contact [GroupDocs sales](http://groupdocs.com/corporate/contact-us) for a free 30-day fully-functional license to be able to test the module without any evaluation restrictions.
