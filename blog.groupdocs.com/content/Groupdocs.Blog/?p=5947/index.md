[![GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET Library logo](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/02/GD_ANT_NETIcon_114.png)](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-annotation-library)We’re pleased to announce the release of a plugin that lets GetSimple developers and site owners to seamlessly integrate the [GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET library](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-annotation-library) into their websites. Once deployed, the library enables end users to view and collaboratively annotate 50+ types of documents and images straight on your website. To name a few, supported file formats include: PDF and Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, CAD drawings and raster images (TIFF, JPEG, PNG, GIF and BMP). **How does GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET work? ** The library converts documents to a web-compatible content (HTML/CSS + images) on the server and then renders it on your website within a document view widget along with an annotation toolbar. End users can view and annotate such embedded documents from any standard web-browser. You don’t have to worry about whether your users have the software required to open a document. The same document can be annotated by several invited users simultaneously. Each user can add annotations, see others’ comments/markups and reply to them in real time. As a result, all involved parties can get a fast feedback on reviewed documents, discuss the necessary updates and get documents approved in a breeze. GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET has been built from the ground up with security in mind. Original documents embedded to web-pages are not downloaded to user machines during view/annotation sessions, but stay on your server and behind your firewalls. End users only see web-copies of the shared documents. Although available by default, the copy, print and download options can be disabled for specific documents, so that they are shared in a “read-only” mode. Currently we offer two deployment options: on-premises and SaaS. This [new plugin](http://get-simple.info/extend/plugin/groupdocs-annotation-for-net/904/) integrates the downloadable .NET library that can be deployed on your own server and allows you to store and host documents locally. We also offer a plugin that integrates our cloud version of the GroupDocs.Annotation app. It doesn’t require any server-side installations, but documents need to be stored on our servers. We use Amazon EC2 servers to guarantee the security of the service. For more details on the plugins, please visit the GetSimple marketplace:
