## How Does the Healthcare Sector Operate?Organizations in the healthcare sector work with a wide range of information, from patient data, through insurance forms for claims precessing, to sharing financial records, even viewing X-rays and displaying reports, forms and all kinds of files. They need to share, view, and read large amounts of medical records to manage operations efficiently. Disseminating information or reports to doctors, patients, and pharmacies easily and securely is important for a positive customer experience. In a way, viewing and sharing reports is a key task. According to [Plunkett Research Ltd.](http://www.plunkettresearch.com/) market survey in 2011, the global healthcare market was projected to be $5.5 trillion and expected to grow further. With increase spending in medicare from developed and growing markets, healthcare organizations need cutting edge technology that cater to their needs.

## Introduction to Online Document Viewer from GroupDocs[GroupDocs Viewer](http://groupdocs.com/apps/viewer) is an cloud-based application for sharing and viewing documents. GroupDocs' online document viewer tool is software and platform independent, that is, you can view most common file formats online without installing any new software. Our application supports and works with a range of files, from text documents (PDF, Word), reports (Excel), presentations (PPT, ODT), to image files (JPG, GIF, etc.). The rendered document retains the exact quality of the original. The entire process of sharing and viewing documents is smooth. All you need to view a file is a web browser. Let us see how GroupDocs Viewer works in a real-life scenario.

## How Can GroupDocs Viewer Benefit the Healthcare Sector?GroupDocs' online document viewers offers compelling features that can be used to achieve:

*   **Collaboration**: GroupDocs Viewer simplifies the document viewing process. It makes it easy to share documents and lets readers access files through a browser: they don't have to download files, append them to emails or use special software. Information can be shared between departments (for example medical - admin - accounts) without having to worry about whether everyone has the same software.
*   **Multiple File Format Support**: Hospitals share lots of different file formats: spreadsheets, documents, images, medical reports, invoices, etc. GroupDocs Viewer is compatible with all common business file formats so one solution lets you share all files. Share a medical report (ODT) with a doctor, without worrying about cross-platform or cross version issues. All they need is a web browser.
*   **CMS Integration**: Most websites or portals are built using Content Management systems. For example, WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, or ExpressionEngine, and so on. GroupDocs' plugins allow you to embed documents to websites or applications. We support a huge range of CRMs to make sure that you can embed files whatever platform you use. With GroupDocs, it is as easy to embed a file and a viewer as it is to embed a YouTube video. Just copy, paste, and publish.
*   **API and SDK's**: Product companies can leverage GroupDocs API SDK's benefits to integrate the GroupDocs app suite into their applications to make a robust document management platform. Don't code your own document viewer: save ours and save time.
