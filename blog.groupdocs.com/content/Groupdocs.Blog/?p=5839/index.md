Product News

**Advanced options for converting multipage documents to HTML Files in GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET**

In the latest GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET release, we’ve implemented several enhancements that allow developers to have more control over document conversions when the output file is in the HTML format. In particular, we added the option of converting multi-page documents into a single HTML file with all the content (image, texts, etc.) encoded within it. Also, documents can now be obtained directly from streams when converting them to HTML files. For more detail please read release notes and download the latest version on [this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/8/.net-libraries/groupdocs_conversion_for_.net/entry4313.aspx).

**Display Icons and right-to-left language based documents using GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET**

The GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library can now display the Icon file-type and we have added improved support for the display of documents where text is right-to-left based. We also added the page rotation control in the image-based rendering mode. This can also be triggered via a new Javascript API method. Other improvements include an accent-insensitive search option and a Javascript API method for displaying the “loading document” overlay. Please download the latest library from [this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/8/.net-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_.net/default.aspx).
