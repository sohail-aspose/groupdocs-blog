[![GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET Library logo](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/04/GD_VWR_NETIcon_114.png "GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET Library")](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-viewer-library)[GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-viewer-library) is a web-oriented framework which provides ample possibilities to view a wide variety of documents in a web-browser, including PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, AutoCAD and many more. However, quite often there are situations when you are looking for a simple and quick solution and don't need all the functionality that comes with a library. In case of GroupDocs.Viewer, for example, you may not want to use iframes on your pages, or add a lot of additional JavaScript and CSS files, which are used by GroupDocs.Viewer. You may also want to limit the number of asynchronous requests/responses through which the viewer works. Or, strip down the UI and just display documents without options to zoom, print, download, etc. In this article I'm going to show you how to implement such scenario using the GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET library.
