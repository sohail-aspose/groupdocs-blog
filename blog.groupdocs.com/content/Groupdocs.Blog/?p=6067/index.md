A Powerful Document Comparison Engine for Your Apps

GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET is a multi-format document comparison library that allows developers to programmatically compare two Word, PDF, Excel, PowerPoint, plain text or HTML files. The library understands document elements specific to each format, making it possible to compare text, style and layout changes.

GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET comes with a web GUI that displays differences between two documents with a redline Track Changes approach. When integrated into your application, it allows end users to compare documents without having to use any 3rd party office suites.

**GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: enhanced support for email files (EML, MSG)**

Two new GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET versions have been released this month – [2.11.1](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/8/.net-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_.net/entry6488.aspx) and [2.12.0](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/8/.net-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_.net/entry6766.aspx) – with over 45 improvements and bug fixes. We’ve improved the handling of EML and MSG files to make it more convenient for viewers to browse and explore messages without using any 3rd party email clients. In particular, email subjects are now displayed above message bodies and are separated with a horizontal line. If a message includes attachments, these are listed in a separate section. BCC addressees can now be displayed in the email headers.

We also improved rendering accuracy for PDF documents, fixed an issue that caused incorrect text flow when displaying documents in Internet Explorer 9, improved behavior of the search feature in the HTML-based rendering mode and implemented around 15 other minor improvements and bug fixes. For more details on the recent release and to download the library, please [visit this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/8/.net-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_.net/entry6766.aspx).

**GroupDocs.Viewer for Java: support for multi-page TIFF files and improved rendering accuracy**

In this month’s release of GroupDocs.Viewer for Java we’ve added the ability to display large multi-page TIFF files, implemented a number of changes to better handle PowerPoint slides, improved overall rendering accuracy and made over 17 minor improvements and bug fixes in total. For more details on this release and to download the library, please [visit this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/9/java-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_java/entry6489.aspx).

**Coming soon: completely rebuilt .NET, Java and RESTful APIs**

We’re pleased to announce that we’ve started developing completely new versions of the GroupDocs product suites. These new versions will keep their core functionality, but will have more powerful and faster engines along with streamlined APIs. These products will be built from the ground up as middleware to let developers seamlessly integrate them into any workflow. These new products will be ideal for commercial software developers, system integrators and enterprises who want to add comprehensive document collaboration functionality to their desktop, online, SaaS or mobile products. The first major update - GroupDocs.Conversion for .NET library – is already planned for release in the coming month, so stay tuned for more news!
