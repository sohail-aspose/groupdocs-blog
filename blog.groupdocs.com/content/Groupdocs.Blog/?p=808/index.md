We are happy to announce that we've integrated **GroupDocs** with several 3rd party platforms in the last month. An important integration was with Windows Azure, which gives our users another storage service option for their documents. In September, a few more integrations are in the pipeline, including the **[GroupDocs Viewer plugins](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/plugins/viewer)** for Concrete5, Moodle 1.9, Moodle 2.x, SugarCRM, and TinyMCE. We're also working on a number of application enhancements. ![](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/09/title-july1.png "New Features") We're always enhancing the GroupDocs user experience with new features. Here is a list of some features that we’ve added recently. Log in to your GroupDocs account and try out the improvements!
