We're pleased with the positive feedback on the new UI that we've received in the last few weeks. In June, we launched our [pricing plans](http://groupdocs.com/purchase/cloud-app-pricing), with flexible options that will suit companies large and small. You can read all about them in our [blog](https://blog.groupdocs.com/groupdocs-introduced-new-pricing-plans-for-its-document-management-solutions). In the next month, we're working on various storage integration options and other improvement.
