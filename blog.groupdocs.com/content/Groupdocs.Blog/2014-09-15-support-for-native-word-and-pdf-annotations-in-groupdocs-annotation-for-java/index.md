It allows end users to review, annotate and comment on **over 50 types of documents**. The library supports Microsoft Office and OpenDocument formats, PDFs, images, AutoCAD drawings and others. A rich set of tools allows users to draw lines, place watermarks and pointers, redact and comment text, strike through and underline it. And thanks to its cross-browser compatibility, the library lets users to annotate documents literally from any web-enabled device using just a browser and without having to install any third party software or plugins. The library has seen a number of improvements in the recent releases. In this article I'd like to introduce the most notable improvements.

### Support for Native PDF & Microsoft Word AnnotationsStarting from version 1.5, GroupDocs.Annotation for Java supports native PDF and Word annotations. This means that annotations in a PDF document can be imported to GroupDocs.Annotation for further online review and editing. Also, annotations made with GroupDocs.Annotation can be exported to a PDF or Word file with the annotations in them for further offline editing.

### Support for Microsoft Word’s “Change Tracking” FeatureAnother useful feature supported in the newest version of the library is the “track changes” mechanism from Microsoft Word. Word documents annotated with the GroupDocs.Annotation for Java can now be exported to a Word (DOC/DOCX) file with the edits (comments, markups, etc.) highlighted with the Word’s “track changes” feature.
