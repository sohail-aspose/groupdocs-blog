[![GroupDocs.Conversion for Java Library](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/12/GD_CNV_JavaIcon_114.png)](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-conversion-library)We’re pleased to announce the release of a new version of GroupDocs.Conversion for Java library – 1.2.0. In this release we’ve implemented three major updates. Probably the most interesting among them - is the ability to convert all supported file formats to HTML (including PDF to HTML, Microsoft Word to HTML and [many more](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-conversion-library/features)). We also added support for Microsoft Word bookmarks and the ability to convert and merge several documents into one PDF file.

### Convert PDF and Microsoft Office Documents to HTMLWith this feature, you can now convert files of any format supported by GroupDocs.Conversion for Java to HTML. To name just a few, the library allows you to convert:

*   PDF to HTML
*   Microsoft Word (DOC, DOCX) to HTML
*   Microsoft Excel (XLS, XLSX) to HTML
*   Microsoft PowerPoint (PPT, PPTX) to HTML
*   Microsoft Outlook (MSG, EML) to HTML
*   Microsoft Project (MPP, MPT) to HTML
*   Microsoft Visio (VSD, VSDX) to HTML
*   OpenDocument (ODT, ODS, OTT) to HTML

Source documents can be obtained either from files or from streams. And in the output you can also get either a complete web-page saved in a file (HTML + CSS + images) or send converted data (texts, images, fonts and other document elements) to streams. Documents can be converted one-by-one on-demand or in batch. You can configure the library to convert one specific page within a document to HTML, all document pages to equivalent number of individual HTMLs (page-by-page), or all document pages to one single HTML file.
