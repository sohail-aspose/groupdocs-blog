PDF is a widely used document format that also supports interactive elements including annotations, forms, 3D objects, layers, etc. Along with these elements, PDF format also supports setting restrictions such as print restriction, modification restriction, restrictions on data extraction and so on. Such features give the user more control over the document and therefore, the PDF has become a popular document format.

Since we support the rendering of PDF documents, therefore, we always keep looking to introduce features that may give you more information about the documents. Hence, we provided the detection of print restriction in the PDF documents in [GroupDocs.Viewer for Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/java) 19.3.

Well, we have made it quite easy for you to [detect print restrictions in a PDF document](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/java). The following code snippet shows how to get this information using _getDocumentInfo()_ method:

Not only this, but we have also extended the list of our supported document formats with the addition of the following formats in v19.3:

*   TSV (Tab-separated values)
*   PCL (Printer command language)

Well, these could be the interesting additions in the API for you. If yes, let's not wait and [download](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/viewer/java) the latest version of GroupDocs.Viewer for Java. To evaluate the API features, you may clone and explore the examples project from [GitHub repository](https://github.com/groupdocs-viewer/GroupDocs.Viewer-for-Java).
