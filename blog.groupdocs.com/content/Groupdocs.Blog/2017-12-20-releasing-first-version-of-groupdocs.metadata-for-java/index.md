# Example Business Cases

GroupDocs.Metadata aims to help a lot in various fields of life. For example, while sharing the crucial documents, a business party may not want to expose the confidentiality of its business and employees as well through the reports/documents they prepare. So, just before sending these bulks of reports to the other party, removal of all confidential metadata from the reports is mandatory. GroupDocs.Metadata is the perfect API to serve in this situation. In order to elaborate real-life needs, we have envisaged some real-life cases.
