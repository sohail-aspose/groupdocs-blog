Continuing the [series of articles](https://blog.groupdocs.com/category/annotation) related to GroupDocs.Annotation, this time I'd like to show you how to customize the look and feel of the GroupDocs.Annotation for Java UI. GroupDocs.Annotation for Java is a flexible library that allows end-users to annotate, mark up and comment on documents of more than 50 common formats from within you own app. For more information on the library, please [see this page](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-annotation-library). The article provides detailed instructions that will help you make a custom user interface based on the GroupDocs.Annotation for Java library and seamlessly integrate it into your own app. It mainly covers customization of the navigation controls and collaboration events handling. Also, a sample code project is provided for better understanding of how the interface can be tweaked.
