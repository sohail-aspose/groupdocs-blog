Are you looking for a full-text search API that allows you to search over a lot of document formats? In that case, GroupDocs.Search for .NET will meet your requirements. API creates index and then perform instant search across thousands of documents.

Those who are already working with the API, we have some new features and improvements. Moreover, some classes have been renamed to improve code readability. There are minor changes in the new version [19.10](https://docs.groupdocs.com/display/searchnet/GroupDocs.Search+for+.NET+19.10+Release+Notes), so the migration will not be too difficult. API architecture is optimized for better performance.  
After upgrading to v19.10, you need to replace the namespace usage across the entire project from _GroupDocs.Search_ to _GroupDocs.Search.Legacy_ to resolve build issues.

Lets go though the code changes:  
Old code sample:

New code snippet:  
{{< gist GroupDocsGists 4919cfb96e5041b92507e8b2935a047b "newsearchcode.cs" >}}

You can observe the minor changes (e.g. _SearchParameters_ is changed to  
_SearchOptions_).

**Improvements**  

*   Highlight search results in short fragments
*   Enhance document metadata indexing with new formats

**New Features**

*   Index each letter as a separate word
*   Implemented ability to remove paths from index

**How to highlight search results in short fragments?**  
This improvement allows highlighting the search results in separate short fragments of the text, and not in the whole document. Below example shows how to generate short HTML snippets with highlighted found terms:

**How to enhance document metadata indexing with new formats?**  
This improvement adds support for new document formats. These are mostly documents, the main content of which is not textual, therefore only the metadata of these documents is indexed:

*   MP3 – MPEG-2 Audio Layer III;
*   WAV – Waveform Audio File Format;
*   BMP – Bitmap Picture;
*   GIF – Graphical Interchange Format File;
*   JP2 – JPEG 2000 Core Image File;

**How to index each letter as a separate word?**  
This feature is designed to work with _hieroglyphic languages_ and allows you to index each character in the text as a separate word, regardless of the presence of separators.

**Ability to remove paths from index**  
When indexed paths are removed from an index, the index is updated and all removed documents and folders become inaccessible for search.
