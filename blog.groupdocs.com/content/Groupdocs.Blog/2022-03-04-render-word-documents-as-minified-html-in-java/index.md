## Java API to Render as Minified HTML {#stl-viewer-dotnet-api}

[GroupDocs.Viewer](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/) showcases a [document viewing API](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/) that allows rendering various types of documents into HTML, PDF, and image formats within Java applications. I will use this API in the example to convert the Microsoft Word DOCX file into a clean HTML file.

You can download the **JAR** file from the [downloads section](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/viewer/java) or use the latest repository and dependency [Maven](https://repository.groupdocs.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/groupdocs) configurations within your Java applications.

## Render Word DOC/DOCX to Minified HTML in Java {#stl-to-pdf}

HTML files can be generated either having embedded or external resources using respective methods. The following steps show how to render the Word (DOC/DOCX) document into minified HTML in Java.

*   Load the DOCX file using the [Viewer](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer/Viewer) class.
*   Prepare the HTML rendering options using the [HtmlViewOptions](https://apireference.groupdocs.com/viewer/java/com.groupdocs.viewer.options/HtmlViewOptions) class.
*   Enable the minification option by setting it to true.
*   Use the **view()** with the created options to render the DOCX file as minified HTML.

The following Java code example renders the Word DOCX file into minified HTML.
