We're glad to announce the launch of [GroupDocs' annotation plugin for Moodle](http://groupdocs.com/marketplace/plugins/annotation/moodle). GroupDocs Annotation, an online annotation app, is popular with our users because it lets them annotate and review most popular file formats from a web-browser. Upload any document that you want a team to review to a GroupDocs account. Then copy and paste the embed link to a Moodle page. Invite and share the link with members to start collaborative annotation. Moodle CMS displays the embedded document and makes file sharing easy and simple. [GroupDocs Annotation ](http://groupdocs.com/apps/annotation)lets you annotate PDF and other files from a web-browser. A wide set of annotation option allows reviewers to add comments the way that suits them best: by adding comments, for example, or drawing on the document. In minutes, members working across different time-zones can collaborate and suggest changes. All comments are saved in a single file that helps publishing teams expedite the review cycle.

## GroupDocs Annotation: BenefitsDocument review processes are often long. A document must go through different checks and is reviewed by different divisions in an organization. Sometimes, the existing process does not use employees time the best way it could. GroupDocs Annotation offers compelling document management benefits to individuals and organizations. It's a Cloud app, and Cloud apps have transformed the way organizations operate. They reduce cost, can improve productivity and facilitate team collaboration. Some of the benefits of GroupDocs Annotation are:

*   **Wide file format support**: Supports a wide-range of file formats from text, spreadsheets, PDF, or image files.
*   **Collaboration**: Share a link or invite members via email. Within minutes, team members collaborate online.
*   **Integration**: Download and install the plugin to your CMS and embed the document directly from GroupDocs.
*   **Access rights**: Restrict document rights (download, print, or copy) when sharing documents to prevent unauthorized use.
*   **View comments in side panel**: Read the comments made by each reviewer to keep updated and avoid repeating comments.
*   **Presentation mode**: View documents in real-time, broadcasting mouse, scroll and zoom events.
