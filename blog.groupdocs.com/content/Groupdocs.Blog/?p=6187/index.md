Product News

**GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET: A new DOC & DOCX comparison engine**

We've enhanced DOC and DOCX comparison functionality with our new comparison engine as well as extending both PDF and DOC comparison to support better styling change detection. We've also improved the multi-thread support for web based environments, increased performance and stability and extended the product API.

You can download the latest version of GroupDocs.Comparison for .NET from [this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/8/.net-libraries/groupdocs_comparison_for_.net/default.aspx).

**GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET: Enhanced Support For WCF self-hosting mode**

In GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET 2.15.0 we’ve improved the ability to use the HTML-based engine and PDF printing within the WCF self-hosting mode. Page rotations and page reordering are now also supported in WCF self-hosting mode.

Another important improvement is custom storage provider support in the DocumentCache class. It gives more control over GroupDocs.Viewer temporary files (page representations, document descriptions, etc.). This can be useful for adding encrypted data to the cache.

You can download the latest version of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET from [this page](http://groupdocs.com/Community/files/8/.net-libraries/groupdocs_viewer_for_.net/default.aspx).

Good news for WordPress web developers and website owners. Recently we released a plugin that allows you to integrate GroupDocs.Viewer for Java into your WordPress website. With this new plugin, you now have a choice between 3 different versions of GroupDocs’ multi-format HTML5 document viewer: a downloadable .NET library, a Java library for on-premises deployment, or cloud-based integration.
