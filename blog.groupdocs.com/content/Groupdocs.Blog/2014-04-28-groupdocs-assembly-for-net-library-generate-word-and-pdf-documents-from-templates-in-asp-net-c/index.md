![GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET Logo](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/04/GD_ASM_NETIcon_114.png)We are pleased to announce the release of the new library that enhances a set of our document collaboration tools - [GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET](http://groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-assembly-library). The library generates PDF and Word documents from templates by automatically filling out merge fields with custom data. If your company or a client have to create tens or hundreds of documents by filling out standard templates with data obtained through user input or from a DB, this library can be of great help. Just to mention a few examples, it can be used to generate legal documents, insurance policies, invoices, bills, NDAs, order quotes, offer letters, and any other types of documents. The library can be installed with just a single DLL and allows you to easily embed document generation functionality into your ASP.NET / C# application. The server part of the library is deployed in conjunction with a web UI, which allows end users to prepare templates and get completed documents without any help from developers. The workflow is simple: 1. Users create templates in a Word or PDF format by adding merge fields to documents. Templates can be prepared in any office software that supports PDF or DOC/DOCX file editing. 2. GroupDocs.Assembly's wizards guide users through composing questionnaires (interviews) where each question is associated with a merge field in the templates. The questionnaires can be then embed into a web page or an application. 3. For each completed questionnaire, GroupDocs.Assembly generates a new, unique document by incorporating data entered through the questionnaire into the template. The finished document is available for download right away. 4. **Update:** starting from version 1.0.5, the GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET library includes a **template editor** component, meaning you can now not only generate documents based on your existing templates, but actually create new DOC/DOCX/PDF templates without the need to use Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat. With this new component, GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET covers a complete document generation cycle: 1) Create a new template or edit an existing one -> 2) Connect the template to a data source (a DB or user input) -> 3) Get completed documents that look like the template but incorporate data from your sources. For more details on this new version, its key components and features please refer to our new post [on this page](https://blog.groupdocs.com/groupdocs-assembly-for-dot-net-generate-word-and-pdf-documents-form-templates-in-c-sharp-vb-net-asp-net).
