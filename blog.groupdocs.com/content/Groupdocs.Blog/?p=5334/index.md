[![GroupDocs.Viewer for Java icon](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/GD_VWR_JavaIcon_1141.png "GroupDocs.Viewer for Java")](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library)Recently we released a new module which allows developers to seamlessly integrate the Java version of our HTML5 document viewer into DNN websites. Today we're pleased to announce that the module has been approved and officially published on the [DNN marketplace](http://store.dnnsoftware.com/home/product-details/groupdocs-viewer-for-java-pdf-office-document-viewer). [GroupDocs.Viewer for Java library](http://groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library) is an HTML5 document that allows you to embed and display 50+ types of documents on any page within your website. Formats include PDF and Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint slides, Visio diagrams and a lot more. The Java version is the third DNN module we've released for the GroupDocs HTML5 document viewer. Now you can choose between 3 deployment options for the viewer: a downloadable .NET or Java library, which can be hosted on-premises, or a cloud-based on-demand service. For more details on the viewer and available deployment options, please see [this page](http://groupdocs.com/html5-document-viewer).
