Cleaning and Minification of HTML improve the load time and bandwidth usage of the webpages.

## .NET API to Render as Minified HTML {#stl-viewer-dotnet-api}

[GroupDocs.Viewer](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/) provides a [document viewing API](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/net/) that allows rendering various documents into HTML, PDF, and image formats within the .NET application. I will use this API in the examples to convert the DOCX file into a clean HTML file.

You can download the DLLs or MSI installer from the [downloads section](https://downloads.groupdocs.com/viewer/net) or install the API in your .NET application via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/groupdocs.viewer).

```
PM> Install-Package GroupDocs.Viewer
```
