Event notifications in GroupDocs.Signature are designed to make it easy to involve the right parties at each step in the online signature workflow, and keep you informed on the signature progress. Notifications help invite signers via emails, inform you when someone has completed a form or signed a document, inform all parties when a document has been closed, etc. GroupDocs.Signature offers a number of standard notification messages that can be triggered at different stages during the signature workflow.
