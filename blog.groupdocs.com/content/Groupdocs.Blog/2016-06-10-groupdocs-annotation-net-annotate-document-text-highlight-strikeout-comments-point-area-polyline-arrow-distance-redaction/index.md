[![GroupDocs Annotation logo](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/06/groupdocs-annotation.png)](http://www.groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-annotation-library)

In the world of APIs, [GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET](http://www.groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-annotation-library) has reborn to introduce more flexible, stand alone and powerful back-end API which comes with an extensive number of markup tools to annotate the documents with area annotation, text highlight, text underline, text strikeout, watermarking, reply based comments and many more. Next Generation GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET 3.0 is disintegrated from the UI to provide developers a free hand to create desktop, web or cloud applications without any bound. Let's not wait and see how it is going to serve the users.

## Why it came into being?The legacy 2.x versions of GroupDocs.Annotation for .NET had complex API structure along with UI requiring more coding efforts for a simple implementation. Secondly, it was tightly coupled with the development platforms and required specific ways of code implementation for each development environment. Whereas, next generation API exposes only UI less back-end annotation features in which simplified object oriented approach is implemented. In order to get more control over Annotations Management Processes (Adding, Removing, and Editing) in your PDF document, a new release of GroupDocs.Annotation is on board by GroupDocs team. **[Read more](http://www.groupdocs.com/docs/display/annotationnet/Introducing+GroupDocs.Annotation+for+.NET) **
