[![GroupDocs.Text for .NET](http://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2018/05/groupdocs-parser.png)](https://products.groupdocs.com/)We are pleased to announce that GroupDocs.Text for .NET has been renamed to [GroupDocs.Parser for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/parser/net). We have published the first monthly release as GroupDocs.Parser for .NET 18.5 after renaming of the API. The latest release has come with a few changes and a couple of enhancements. Please continue to read about the changes and the enhancements that we have made in version 18.5.

## Important to KnowIt is important to inform you that the renaming of the API will not disturb your existing code and the API structure still remains the same. You will only have to make the following changes in your code:

*   All the namespaces that started with _GroupDocs.Text_ have been renamed and now they start with _GroupDocs.Parser_, e.g. _GroupDocs.Text.Containers_ namespace has been renamed to _GroupDocs.Parser.Containers_.
*   _GroupDocsTextException_ class has been renamed to _GroupDocsParserException_.

## EnhancementsFollowing are the enhancements that we have made in GroupDocs.Parser for .NET 18.5:
