Furthermore, we have extended our list of supported file formats by adding the support of VCF file format.

# Features Introduced

## Rendering Filtered Messages from Outlook Data FilesThere might be the case when you want to render only the selected messages from Outlook Data Files (OST/PST). To deal with such case, we have introduced a new feature which allows you to filter the messages that you want to render from Outlook Data Files. At the moment, the following filters are available:

*   Filter by subject and content using **_OutlookOptions.TextFilter_**
*   Filter by the sender's and recipient's email addresses using **_OutlookOptions.AddressFilter_**

For a working example, please visit the following documentation article:

*   [Rendering Filtered Messages in Outlook Data Files](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net)

## Rendering Email Messages Contained in Outlook Data FilesGroupDocs.Viewer for .NET now supports getting and rendering email messages that are contained in Outlook Data Files as attachments. These email messages are listed as **_Attachments _**in **_DocumentInfoContainer _**object that is returned by **_GetDocumentInfo _**method of the corresponding **_ViewerHandler_**. For working examples, please visit the following documentation article:

*   [Obtaining and Rendering Email Messages Contained in Outlook Data Files](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net)

## Obtaining Layer's Visibility Status in CAD DocumentsThe CAD document allows setting the visibility of the layers it contains. The layers are invisible when they frozen or switched off, otherwise, they are visible. The latest release of GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET allows getting the visibility status of the layers within a CAD document. This feature can be useful to decide which layer to render relying on a layer's visibility status. For a working example, please visit the following documentation article:

*   [Obtaining Layer's Visibility Status in CAD Documents](https://docs.groupdocs.com/viewer/net)
