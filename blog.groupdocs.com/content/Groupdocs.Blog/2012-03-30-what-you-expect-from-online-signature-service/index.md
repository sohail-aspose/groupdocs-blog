We've already talked about the [benefits of an online signature application](https://blog.groupdocs.com/why-use-online-signature-app). Now we know that a reliable online signature service provides a legal and secure method of signing documents online and helps users increase their productivity in terms of time and money. With this in mind, let's have a closer look at the online document signing process and find out more about GroupDocs' online signature app.

## A Typical Process of Signing a Document with an Online Signature AppA basic online signature workflow includes the following steps:

1.  Select or upload a document you want signed.
2.  Add any necessary fields to the document, including recipient information.
3.  Locate a page and particular section(s) on this page where you'd like to put your and/or your partners' signatures.
4.  Invite partners to sign the document. The online signature app sends notifications to the recipients by email.
5.  Wait for the online signatures to come in. The app sends a notification once the recipients sign the document. A quality online signature app also sends reminder messages to signers who forgot to put their signature.
6.  All the signers are informed once the signing process is completed.
