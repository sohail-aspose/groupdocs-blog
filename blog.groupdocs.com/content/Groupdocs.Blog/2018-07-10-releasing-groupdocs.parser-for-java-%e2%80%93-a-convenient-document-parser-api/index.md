# Example Business Cases

Repetition of data can diminish the worth of an article. Working as a writer, one must follow [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (don't repeat yourself) principle. Cross reading the articles, again and again, may cost a lot of time. Counting the statistics of word's occurrences can endeavor the goal but again it's hard to do it manually. Eventually, you need to read the whole article and keep track of the words. GroupDocs.Parser may help in this case. In order to elaborate real-life needs, we have envisaged some real-life cases.
