# Introduction

We've recently introduced a set of [new pricing plans](http://groupdocs.com/purchase/cloud-app-pricing) for our [document management solutions](http://groupdocs.com/ "online document management"). Our objective is to make GroupDocs apps appealing to all types of users or groups, regardless of their size. We have launched these new plans after collecting valuable feedback from our customers. \[caption id="attachment\_646" align="alignnone" width="632" caption="Fig.1: GroupDocs introduced new pricing plans for its document management solutions"\]![GroupDocs introduced new pricing plans for its document management solutions ](https://blog.groupdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/06/Pricing-page-new.png)\[/caption\]

# Pricing Plan Types

As well as the **Free** plan, we have three other pricing plans:

*   **Individual**: Available for $10 per month. This plan is ideal for one user. It includes: 1 GB storage capacity, 200 monthly document tokens, 5000 API calls and much more. In addition, you can add as many documents as you like as long as you stay within the specified storage capacity. You also get access to all of the GroupDocs apps.

*   **Group**: Available for $19 per month for up to 9 users. This plan exactly matches the requirements of small to mid-sized group. It includes: 3 GB storage capacity per user, unlimited monthly document tokens, 10000 API calls per user and so on. This plan also lets you use all the GroupDocs apps.

*   **Enterprise**: Available for $24 per month for between 10 and 50 users. This plan starts with 10 users and has an upper limit of 50 users. However, if you want more users, our sales team can help you out. This plan is tailor-made for enterprises with many employees. This plan includes 5 GB storage capacity per user, unlimited monthly document tokens, unlimited API calls per user, etc., in addition to all the features available to the other two plans. The Enterprise plan does not put restrictions on any feature.

We offer world-class security to all our plans by ensuring **256-bit SSL protection**, making all your transactions extremely protected. All these plans are available for **1 month free trial** before you start paying. So this 30 days trail period lets you explore all the features available in your selected plan. This helps you to thoroughly check the application before you seal the deal. We are sure that you will like our applications and would love to stick with us, so this 1 month window is more like a warm-up for our valued subscribers before making a long-term commitment. Apart from introducing these new plans, GroupDocs is still continuing with its **Free** user plan, which has some restrictions on usage. We are really excited that we’ve had all the tools needed for document management under one roof at a nominal price.
