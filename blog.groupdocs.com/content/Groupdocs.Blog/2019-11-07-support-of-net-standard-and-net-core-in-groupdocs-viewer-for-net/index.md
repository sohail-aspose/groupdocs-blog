Hello everyone! We have released v19.10 of [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/net) and I have a piece of breaking news especially for those who requested the support of [.NET Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core). The latest release of the API includes _6_ new features, _2_ improvements, and _11_ bug fixes. So let's have a look at some major updates we have brought for you.

## Support of .NET Standard 2.0

As promised, we have added the support of [.NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard) in v19.10. So now, the API supports the .NET implementations that target .NET Standard 2.0 inlcuding .NET Framework and .NET Core. Thus, you can use GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET API in your cross-platform applications. At the moment, there exist a few limitations when using the API in a non-Windows environment. You can see the details of the limitations and the possible recommendations [here](https://docs.groupdocs.com/display/viewernet/.NET+Standard+2.0+API+Limitations).

## Adjusting Page Size when Rendering Emails as HTML

Previously, the feature of setting page size for email messages was available only for image-based rendering. However, we have extended it for HTML-based rendering as well. Now, you can control the page size of the resultant HTML pages as shown in the following code sample:
